Therefore, a consensus statement for state-of-the-art exercise prescription in patients with combinations of CVD risk factors as integrated into a digital training and decision support system (the EXercise Prescription in Everyday practice & Rehabilitative Training (EXPERT) tool) needed to be established. EXPERT working group members systematically reviewed the literature for meta-analyses, systematic reviews and/or clinical studies addressing exercise prescriptions in specific CVD risk factors and formulated exercise recommendations (exercise training intensity, frequency, volume and type, session and programme duration) and exercise safety precautions, for obesity, arterial hypertension, type 1 and 2 diabetes, and dyslipidaemia. The impact of physical fitness, CVD risk altering medications and adverse events during exercise testing was further taken into account to fine-tune this exercise prescription. An algorithm, supported by the interactive EXPERT tool, was developed by Hasselt University based on these data. Specific exercise recommendations were formulated with the aim to decrease adipose tissue mass, improve glycaemic control and blood lipid profile, and lower blood pressure. The impact of medications to improve CVD risk, adverse events during exercise testing and physical fitness was also taken into account. Simulations were made of how the EXPERT tool provides exercise prescriptions according to the variables provided.

Thanks to advances in new forms of cognitive behavioral therapy (known as third-wave CBT), currently clinicians and researchers have an empirically validated psychological treatment with increasing research support for the treatment of chronic pain. This treatment is called acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). The main aim of this paper is to provide a narrative review that summarizes and integrates the current state of knowledge of ACT in the management of chronic pain as well as discuss current challenges and opportunities for progress. Based on the psychological flexibility model, ACT extends previous forms of CBT and integrates many CBT-related variables into six core therapeutic processes. ACT is a process-based therapy that fosters openness, awareness, and engagement through a wide range of methods, including exposure-based and experiential methods, metaphors, and values clarification. To our knowledge, there are three published systematic reviews and meta-analyses that support the effectiveness of ACT for chronic pain and many studies focused on specific processes derived from the psychological flexibility model. There is also promising support for the cost-effectiveness of ACT; however, the current evidence is still insufficient to establish firm conclusions about cost-effectiveness and the most efficient means of delivery. Additional well-designed economic evaluations are needed.

At least 14 different compression products were used, with at least 6 different pressures in 7 different regimes with durations from 2 to 84 days. There was no evidence of any convergence of practice over time. Conclusions A lack of evidence as to the optimal strategy for compression has resulted in a marked variation in clinical practice.

In addition, 10 RCTs and 1 cohort study compared different treatments for osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot. Results of comparisons of different antibiotic regimens generally demonstrated that newly introduced antibiotic regimens appeared to be as effective as conventional therapy (and also more cost-effective in one study), but one study failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of a new antibiotic compared with that of a standard agent. Overall, the available literature was both limited in both the number of studies and the quality of their design.

Understanding the motivating factors and barriers towards exercise for people with SMI would help to maximize exercise participation. A search of major electronic databases was conducted from inception until May 2016. Quantitative studies providing proportional data on the motivating factors and/or barriers towards exercise among patients with SMI were eligible. Random-effects meta-analyses were undertaken to calculate proportional data and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for motivating factors and barriers toward exercise. From 1468 studies, 12 independent studies of 6431 psychiatric patients were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analyses showed that 91% of people with SMI endorsed 'improving health' as a reason for exercise (N = 6, n = 790, 95% CI 80-94). Among specific aspects of health and well-being, the most common motivations were 'losing weight' (83% of patients), 'improving mood' (81%) and 'reducing stress' (78%).

Associations with cardiovascular outcomes and skipping breakfast in adults have been reported. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the association of skipping breakfast with body weight and metabolic outcomes in the pediatric population. We searched relevant databases (2008\u207b2018) and identified 56 articles, of which 39 were suitable to be included, basing on inclusion criteria (observational; defined breakfast skipping; weight and/or metabolic outcomes). Overall, 286,804 children and adolescents living in 33 countries were included. The definitions of OW/OB, skipping breakfast, and the nutrient assessment were highly heterogeneous. Confounding factors were reported infrequently. The prevalence of skipping breakfast ranged 10\u207b30%, with an increasing trend in adolescents, mainly in girls. Skipping breakfast was associated with OW/OB in the 94.7% of the subjects. The lack of association was shown mainly in infants. Moreover, 16,130 subjects were investigated for cardiometabolic outcomes. Skipping breakfast was associated with a worse lipid profile, blood pressure levels, insulin-resistance, and metabolic syndrome. Five studies reported a lower quality dietary intake in breakfast skippers. This review supports skipping breakfast as an easy marker of the risk of OW/OB and metabolic diseases, whether or not it is directly involved in causality.

There might be an optimal dietary fat to carbohydrate ratio for prevention and treatment of obesity. According to the Japanese Dietary Reference Intakes (RDA) for 2010, the optimal fat intake is 20-30% of energy for ages 1-29 y and 20-25% for ages 30 y and over. Upper boundary values of this recommendation were the median of the percentage of energy from dietary fat in Japanese. In a systematic review to estimate the optimal dietary fat to carbohydrate ratio, it was found that obese subjects with hyperinsulinemia (or insulin resistance) lost more weight on a mild low-carbohydrate (LC) (or low-glycemic load diet; 40% carbohydrate, 30-35% fat) than on a low-fat (LF) diet (55-60% carbohydrate, 20% fat), whereas those without hyperinsulinemia showed the opposite. In non-obese primarily insulin-sensitive subjects, decreasing fat rather than carbohydrate intake is generally more effective to prevent obesity. Physiological and molecular evidence supports this conclusion. Increased carbohydrate intake, especially in high-glycemic food, leads to postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, which are exaggerated in obese insulin-resistant subjects. Even in an insulin-resistant state, insulin is able to stimulate fatty acid synthesis in liver, activate lipoprotein lipase, and prevent lipolysis in adipose tissues, which all facilitate adipose tissue enlargement. Optimal dietary fat to carbohydrate ratio may differ in populations depending on their prevalence for obesity. Because the prevalence of overweight/obesity in Japanese is low, a LF diet is recommended in the general population."}, "pico": {"P": "Japanese population with varying levels of obesity and insulin sensitivity", "I": "Optimal dietary fat to carbohydrate ratio (e.g., low-fat vs. low-carbohydrate diet)", "C": "Comparison of different dietary fat to carbohydrate ratios", "O": "Weight loss, insulin sensitivity, prevention of obesity, metabolic markers"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00000611", "NCT00130299", "NCT00327821", "NCT00254215"], "pub_date": "2011/01/01"}

The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the literature on the hypoalgesic effects of SMT on pain sensitivity measures and to quantify these effects using meta-analysis. We performed a systematic search of articles using CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus from each databases' inception until May 2011. We examined methodological quality of each study and generated pooled effect size estimates using meta-analysis software. Of 997 articles identified, 20 met inclusion criteria for this review. Pain sensitivity testing used in these studies included chemical, electrical, mechanical, and thermal stimuli applied to various anatomical locations. Meta-analysis was appropriate for studies examining the immediate effect of SMT on mechanical pressure pain threshold (PPT). SMT demonstrated a favorable effect over other interventions on increasing PPT. Subgroup analysis showed a significant effect of SMT on increasing PPT at the remote sites of stimulus application supporting a potential central nervous system mechanism. Future studies of SMT related hypoalgesia should include multiple experimental stimuli and test at multiple anatomical sites."}, "pico": {"P": "Individuals experiencing musculoskeletal pain", "I": "Spinal manipulation (SMT)", "C": "Other interventions", "O": "Increase in mechanical pressure pain threshold (PPT)"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00922220"], "pub_date": "2012/10/01"}

Medline, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and abstracts from the American Society of Hematology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of either induction or maintenance thalidomide in adults with previously untreated myeloma. Nine RCTs of induction thalidomide, three RCTs of maintenance thalidomide, and one RCT of induction and maintenance thalidomide were identified, involving a total of 4144 subjects. When thalidomide was added to standard, non-transplantation myeloma therapy, overall survival (OS) improved (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.56-0.81). When thalidomide was given as maintenance following autologous transplantation (ASCT), there was a trend to improved OS (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37-1.01); when the only trial which combined induction and maintenance thalidomide was excluded from this analysis, a significant survival advantage emerged (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.32-0.74).

Overall, significant reductions on waist circumference following treatment of liraglutide--1.8 mg once daily (-5.24 cm, 95% CI -7.68, -2.93), liraglutide--1.2 mg once daily (-4.73 cm, 95% CI -6.68, -2.65) and exenatide--10 \u03bcg twice daily (-1.34 cm, 95 % CI -2.00, -0.75) were detected versus placebo. The reduction effect was more evident when compared with insulin and thiazolidinediones (range -1.71 to -8.03 cm). Compared with exenatide, liraglutide--0.6 mg once daily, taspoglutide, liraglutide--1.2 mg once daily and liraglutide--1.8 mg once daily significantly decreased waist circumference from -3.32 to -6.01 cm. Besides, liraglutide--1.8 mg once daily significantly decreased waist circumference by -1.73 cm (95 % CI -3.04, -0.55) versus sitagliptin, whereas no significant difference following liraglutide--1.2-mg-once-daily treatment was detected compared with liraglutide--1.8 mg once daily and sitagliptin. Reduction was observed with statistical significance for exenatide--10 \u03bcg twice daily compared with exenatide--5 \u03bcg twice daily (-1.21 cm, 95% CI -2.43, -0.06). Ranking probability analysis indicated liraglutide--1.8 mg once daily and liraglutide--1.2 mg once daily decreased waist circumference most among all 12 treatments with probability of 98.36% and 91.82%, respectively. Some GLP-1RAs, especially liraglutide--1.8 mg once daily and liraglutide--1.2 mg once daily, were associated with a significant reduction in waist circumference."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with type 2 diabetes", "I": "GLP-1 receptor agonists (specifically liraglutide and exenatide)", "C": "Placebo, traditional anti-diabetic drugs, insulin, thiazolidinediones, sitagliptin, different doses of liraglutide and exenatide", "O": "Reduction in waist circumference"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT01208012", "NCT00765817"], "pub_date": "2015/04/01"}

In particular, the current literature supports the use of Ginkgo biloba, resveratrol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate and l-theanine, Theobroma cacao, Bacopa monnieri, Crocus sativus and curcumin, which might have a positive impact on cognitive impairment used alone or in combination with other nutraceuticals or traditional drugs. Then, the aim of the present study was to review and comment the available evidence on botanicals and phytochemicals with a clinically demonstrable effect on cognitive decline. For this reason, we carefully reviewed studies published in English language from 1970 to April 2017 on botanicals and phytochemical claiming to show an effect on cognitive impairment in humans. Thus, the terms 'botanicals', 'dietary supplements', 'herbal drug', 'nutraceuticals', 'phytochemical', 'cognitive impairment', 'Alzheimer's disease', 'clinical trial', and 'humans', alone and in combinations, were incorporated into an electronic search strategy in both MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). As it emerges from this systematic review, the use of some phytochemicals and botanicals seems to be very promising in order to delay the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and other age-related diseases.

The applicants challenged a government decision to offer Nevirapine in a few pilot sites when evidence showed Nevirapine significantly reduced HIV transmission rates and despite donor offers of a free supply. The government refused to expand access, arguing they needed to collect more information, and citing concerns about long-term hazards, side effects, resistance and inadequate infrastructure. The court ruled this violated children's right to health and asked the government to immediately expand access. Cluster randomized trials involving children are increasingly popular, and are often used to reduce 'contamination': the possibility that members of a cluster adopt behavior of other clusters. However, they raise unique issues insufficiently addressed in literature and ethical guidelines. This case provides additional crucial guidance, based on a common human rights framework, for the Kenyan government and other involved stakeholders. Children possess special rights, often represent a 'captive' group, and so motivate extra consideration. In a systematic review, we therefore investigated whether cluster trial designs are used to prevent or delay children's access to treatment in Kenya or otherwise inconsistently with children's right to health as outlined in the above case. Although we did not find state sponsored cluster trials, most had significant public sector involvement. Core obligations under children's right to health were inadequately addressed across trials. Few cluster trials reported rationale for cluster randomization, offered post- trial access or planned to implement successful interventions. A small number of trials may have unnecessarily evaluated proven interventions, offered their control arm trial conditions worse than local standards of care or evaluated interventions ostensibly worse than local standards of care. Further research is required to establish if children's right to health in cluster trials is well understood and to explain why some obligations are unmet."}, "pico": {"P": "Children in Kenya participating in cluster randomized trials", "I": "Cluster randomized trial designs affecting children's right to health", "C": "Standard care or alternative trial conditions", "O": "Impact on children's access to treatment, adherence to children's right to health, and ethical considerations in cluster randomized trials"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT01088958"], "pub_date": "2014/07/16"}

Twelve manuscripts, which reported 10 RCTs, representing 1147 participants were included. Only data from five high- or moderate-quality trials were pooled according to clinical setting. There was no difference in disability between inpatient MDT care and any comparison group [mean difference (95% confidence intervals) 0.04, -0.13 to 0.20] or between outpatient MDT care and comparison groups (0.09, -0.07 to 0.25) at 12 months.

Overweight and obesity are major risk factors for several chronic diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer), reduce quality of life, and are associated with higher mortality. For all these reasons, it is of the utmost importance that the trend be reversed and obese people enabled to lose weight. It is known that eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly can help prevent obesity, but data show that in many cases these steps are not enough. This is the reason why, over the last few decades, several antiobesity drugs have been developed. However, the disappointing results demonstrated for the vast majority of them have not discouraged the pharmaceutical industry from continuing to look for an effective drug or combination of drugs. The systematic review presented here focuses on naltrexone sustained-release/bupropion sustained-release combination (Contrave(\u00ae)). We conclude from the current published reports that its effectiveness in the treatment of obesity can be estimated as a placebo-subtracted weight loss of around 4.5%.

A systematic review was performed to evaluate the relationship between coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden changes measured by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and CVD outcomes. Research design and methods Rigorous systematic review methodology was used to identify prospective studies of any design assessing the relationship between atherosclerotic plaque volume (percentage or total atheroma volume [PAV or TAV]) changes and CVD outcomes, using multivariable analyses. Main outcome measures CVD outcomes including major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs). Results Literature searches from inception to February 2015 retrieved 6958 records after de-duplication. From these four studies (14 papers) were included. One study reported a significantly lower rate of CVD outcomes associated with a greater reduction in PAV (hazard ratio [HR] 0.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.83). One study reported that large plaque volume was significantly associated with a greater risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) (HR 1.73, 95% CI: 1.02-2.96). Similarly, a third study reported a significant increase in MACE with an increase in baseline PAV (HR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.06-2.51). Only one potentially inadequately powered Japanese study did not find a statistically significant relationship between PAV changes and MACE. Conclusions The current evidence suggests an independent and statistically significant association between increases in coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden measured by IVUS and greater long-term risk of future CVD outcomes.

However, to date, there has been no systematic review or meta-analysis of these data. The aim of this study is to identify measurable experimental conditions that affect the level of protection against re-infection with S. mansoni in mice vaccinated with radiation attenuated cercariae.

Random effects meta-regression models were used to identify the influential predictors. Three predictors were found to have statistically significant effects on the level of protection from vaccination: increasing numbers of immunizing parasites had a positive effect on fraction of protection whereas increasing radiation dose and time to challenge infection had negative effects.

In addition to increased attention in both research and clinical forums, recent legislation also highlights the importance of patient-centered outcomes research in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. However, whether patient-centered care has been shown to improve outcomes for this population is unclear. To answer this question, we performed a systematic review of the literature that aimed to define current patient-focused management issues, characterize important patient-defined outcomes in asthma control, and identify current and emerging treatments related to patient outcomes and perspectives. We used a parallel search strategy via Medline(\u00ae), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL(\u00ae) (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and PsycINFO(\u00ae), complemented with a reference review of key articles that resulted in a total of 133 articles; 58 were interventions that evaluated the effect on patient-centered outcomes, and 75 were descriptive studies. The majority of intervention studies demonstrated improved patient outcomes (44; \"positive\" results); none showed true harm (0; \"negative\"); and the remainder were equivocal (14; \"neutral\"). Key themes emerged relating to patients' desires for asthma knowledge, preferences for tailored management plans, and simplification of treatment regimens. We also found discordance between physicians and patients regarding patients' needs, beliefs, and expectations about asthma. Although some studies show promise regarding the benefits of patient-focused care, these methods require additional study on feasibility and strategies for implementation in real world settings. Further, it is imperative that future studies must be, themselves, patient-centered (eg, pragmatic comparative effectiveness studies) and applicable to a variety of patient populations and settings.

This systematic review and meta-analysis using individual patient-level data was conducted to better assess the efficacy and safety of this strategy in patients with early breast cancer. Methods The trials in which premenopausal women with early breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy alone or with concurrent GnRHa were eligible for inclusion. Primary end points were premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) rate and post-treatment pregnancy rate. Disease-free survival and overall survival were secondary end points.

The primary aim of the proposed study is to determine the effect of aerobic exercise training (AEX) on the VE/VCO2 slope and NTproBNP. The following databases (up to February 30, 2013) were searched with no language limitations: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, issue 2), MEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January 1980), and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) (from January 1929). We screened reference lists of articles and also conducted an extensive hand search of the literature. Randomized controlled trials of exercise-based interventions with 2-month follow-up or longer compared to usual medical care or placebo were included. The study population comprised adults aged between 18 and 65\u00a0years, with evidence of chronic systolic heart failure (LVEF\u00a0<\u00a045\u00a0% and baseline NTproBNP\u00a0>\u00a0300\u00a0pg/ml). Two review authors independently extracted data on study design, participants, interventions, and outcomes. We assessed the risk of bias using PEDro scale. We calculated mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences between intervention and control groups for outcomes with sufficient data; for other outcomes, we described findings from individual studies. Eight studies involving a total of 408 participants met the inclusion criteria across the NTproBNP (5 studies with 191 patients) and VE/VCO2 slope (4 studies with 217 patients). Aerobic exercise significantly improved NTproBNP by a MD of -817.75 [95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) -929.31 to -706.19]. Mean differences across VE/VCO2 slope were -6.55 (95\u00a0% CI -7.24 to -5.87).

Moreover, the risk of bias across all studies was homogeneous (PEDro scale\u00a0=\u00a07-8 points). However, based on the statistical analysis, the heterogeneity among the studies was still high, which is related to the variable characteristics of the studies. Aerobic exercise may be effective at improving NTproBNP and the VE/VCO2 slope in systolic HF patients, but these effects are limited to a specific HF population meeting specific inclusion criterion in a limited number of studies.

Exercise has been reported as one of the best non-pharmacological ways to improve bone mass throughout life. However, not all exercise regimens have the same positive effects on bone mass, and the studies that have evaluated the role of exercise programmes on bone-related variables in elderly people have obtained inconclusive results. This systematic review aims to summarize and update present knowledge about the effects of different types of training programmes on bone mass in older adults and elderly people as a starting point for developing future interventions that maintain a healthy bone mass and higher quality of life in people throughout their lifetime. A literature search using MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases was conducted and bibliographies for studies discussing the effect of exercise interventions in older adults published up to August 2011 were examined. Inclusion criteria were met by 59 controlled trials, 7 meta-analyses and 8 reviews. The studies included in this review indicate that bone-related variables can be increased, or at least the common decline in bone mass during ageing attenuated, through following specific training programmes. Walking provides a modest increase in the loads on the skeleton above gravity and, therefore, this type of exercise has proved to be less effective in osteoporosis prevention. Strength exercise seems to be a powerful stimulus to improve and maintain bone mass during the ageing process. Multi-component exercise programmes of strength, aerobic, high impact and/or weight-bearing training, as well as whole-body vibration (WBV) alone or in combination with exercise, may help to increase or at least prevent decline in bone mass with ageing, especially in postmenopausal women. This review provides, therefore, an overview of intervention studies involving training and bone measurements among older adults, especially postmenopausal women. Some novelties are that WBV training is a promising alternative to prevent bone fractures and osteoporosis. Because this type of exercise under prescription is potentially safe, it may be considered as a low impact alternative to current methods combating bone deterioration. In other respects, the ability of peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) to assess bone strength and geometric properties may prove advantageous in evaluating the effects of training on bone health. As a result of changes in bone mass becoming evident by pQCT even when dual energy X-ray absortiometry (DXA) measurements were unremarkable, pQCT may provide new knowledge about the effects of exercise on bone that could not be elucidated by DXA. Future research is recommended including longest-term exercise training programmes, the addition of pQCT measurements to DXA scanners and more trials among men, including older participants."}, "pico": {"P": "Older adults and elderly people", "I": "Different types of training programmes (strength, aerobic, high impact, weight-bearing, whole-body vibration)", "C": "No specific comparison group mentioned", "O": "Increase or maintenance of bone mass, prevention of decline in bone mass, improvement in bone-related variables, potential prevention of bone fractures and osteoporosis, assessment of bone strength and geometric properties"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00267839"], "pub_date": "2012/04/01"}

The literature research dating up to October 2018 was performed in the electronic database. The clinical trials about sitagliptin for T2DM patients were included. Two reviewers independently screened literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary outcome was the MACE, and the secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. Finally, 32 clinical trials composed of 16082 T2DM patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that: there was no significant difference between sitagliptin group and the control group on MACE (odds ratio (OR) = 0.85, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 0.63-1.15), myocardial infarction (MI) (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.38-1.16), stroke (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.44-1.54) and mortality (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.26-1.07). These results demonstrated that sitagliptin did not increase the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus", "I": "Treatment with sitagliptin", "C": "Control group without sitagliptin", "O": "Cardiovascular events including major cardiovascular events (MACE), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and mortality"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT01590771", "NCT00397631", "NCT00086502", "NCT00701090", "NCT00305604", "NCT00885352", "NCT00813995", "NCT00350779", "NCT00637273", "NCT00094770"], "pub_date": "2019/07/31"}

Following PRISMA guidelines, we used structured methods to search, screen, and extract data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies reporting quantitative outcomes of acceptability of the VR for any indication published 1/1970-2/2019 (PROSPERO: CRD42019122220).

PDN is known to affect both mental and physical wellbeing, resulting in anxiety, depression, low quality of life and physical disability. Pharmacological treatment of PDN aims at pain relief and is often ineffective and/or has many side effects. Rehabilitation treatment modalities that are designed to help the patient deal with PDN related complaints, are mostly focussed on either physical (e.g. exercise therapy) or psychological aspects (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, CBT). There is emerging evidence that PDN can be approached from a biopsychosocial perspective, in which physical and psychosocial aspects are integrated. From this biopsychosocial approach it is plausible that integrated treatment modalities such as acceptance commitment therapy (ACT) or exposure in vivo (EXP) could be effective in patients with PDN. The objective of this review was to provide an overview of the current evidence on the effects of rehabilitation treatments that combine exercise therapies with psychological therapies in order to improve physical activity (PA) and quality of life (QoL) in patients with PDN. Methods Systematic review of the current literature. EMBASE, MEDLINE, Medline In-Process citations and e-Pubs ahead-of-print, Pedro, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched. All studies on interventions combining exercise therapy with psychological interventions in patients with PDN, aged >18 years, were included. Outcome measures were PA, QoL. Results The search resulted in 1603 records after removing duplicates. After screening on titles and abstracts, 100 records remained. From these, not one study reported on interventions that combined exercise therapy with psychological interventions. Through a secondary hand search, a total of three reviews were identified that described a total of five studies regarding either physical or psychological interventions in patients with PDN. These studies reported moderate effects of (1) mindfulness meditation on QoL, (2) CBT on pain severity, (3) mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention on function, health-related QoL, pain catastrophizing and depression, (4) aerobic exercise on QoL and (5) Tai Chi on glucose control, balance, neuropathic symptoms, and some dimensions of QoL in patients with PDN. All studies were of a moderate quality, and results should be interpreted with caution. Conclusions Based on increasing knowledge in the domain of chronic pain, it could be assumed that integrated rehabilitation treatments for patients with PDN are beneficial. There is no literature to support this and more research should be done on integrated biopsychosocial interventions in patients with PDN. Implications This empty review highlights the importance that more research should be done on integrated biopsychosocial interventions in patients with PDN.

As full-fat dairy products are rich in saturated fat, these dietary guidelines recommend consumption of fat-free or low-fat dairy products in place of full-fat dairy. However, dairy products vary greatly in both their nutrient content and their bioactive ingredients, and research increasingly highlights the importance of focusing on whole foods (i.e., the food matrix) as opposed to single nutrients, such as saturated fat. In fact, the weight of evidence from recent large and well-controlled studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses of both observational studies and randomized controlled trials indicates that full-fat dairy products, particularly yogurt and cheese, do not exert the detrimental effects on insulin sensitivity, blood lipid profile, and blood pressure as previously predicted on the basis of their sodium and saturated fat contents; they do not increase cardiometabolic disease risk and may in fact protect against cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Although more research is warranted to adjust for possible confounding factors and to better understand the mechanisms of action of dairy products on health outcomes, it becomes increasingly clear that the recommendation to restrict dietary saturated fat to reduce risk of cardiometabolic disease is getting outdated. Therefore, the suggestion to restrict or eliminate full-fat dairy from the diet may not be the optimal strategy for reducing cardiometabolic disease risk and should be re-evaluated in light of recent evidence."}, "pico": {"P": "Adults with cardiometabolic disease risk factors", "I": "Consumption of full-fat dairy products", "C": "Consumption of fat-free or low-fat dairy products", "O": "Cardiometabolic disease risk factors such as insulin sensitivity, blood lipid profile, and blood pressure"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT01577030", "NCT02402985", "NCT01140165", "NCT01577030", "NCT01404897", "NCT01317251", "NCT01830946", "NCT01289639", "NCT00000611"], "pub_date": "2019/09/01"}

Several efforts have been made to reduce drug-induced nephrotoxicity; however, DIN remains a matter of concern. Statins with their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects may have the potential to protect kidney against DIN. The present review evaluated all of the available in vitro and in vivo studies that examined the use of statins as renoprotective agents against nephrotoxic drugs. Materials for this review were obtained by searching Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and Cochrane database of systematic reviews. Key words used as search terms included \"statin\", \"3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, \"HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors\", \"nephroprotective\", \"renoprotective\", \"drug-induced renal diseases\", \"drug-induced nephrotoxicity\", \"drug-induced renal toxicity\", \"drug-induced nephropathy\", \"drug-induced renal side effects\", and \"contrast-induced nephropathy\". This search was performed without time limitation. Only English language articles were included in this review. This review concluded that chronic statin user may be less prone to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) compared with statin non-users. Short-term high dose statin administration may also reduce the incidence of CIN in statin na\u00efve patients. This renoprotective effect of statins against CIN is seen in low risk patients with normal kidney function or mild kidney dysfunction, but probably not in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction.

Summary incidence rates, relative risks (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A total of 12,115 patients with a variety of cancer types from 51 RCTs were identified and included in the meta-analysis. Among patients receiving ESAs, the summary incidence of all-grade VTE was 7.78%. Patients with cancer who received ESAs had increased VTE risks (484 events among 6,301 patients treated with ESA vs. 276 events among 5,814 control patients; RR\u2009=\u20091.75 [95% CI, 1.50\u20132.05]). The highest risk of VTE was found in patients with ovarian and cervical cancers (RR\u2009=\u20092.45 [CI\u2009=\u20091.12\u20135.33]). The VTE risk among hematologic malignancies was higher than that among solid tumors. The administration of ESAs was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing VTE in cancer patients receiving these drugs. The risks of VTE may vary with various tumor types, including hematologic malignancies."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with cancer-associated anemia", "I": "Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) for the treatment of cancer-associated anemia", "C": "Control group not receiving ESAs", "O": "Risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients receiving ESAs"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00110955"], "pub_date": "2014/01/01"}

In all patients after correction for tetralogy of Fallot, BNP levels were elevated and correlated significantly with right ventricular end-diastolic dimensions and severity of pulmonary valve regurgitation. Patients with a systemic right ventricle had elevated BNP levels, and positive correlations between BNP and right ventricular function were seen. In patients with a univentricular heart, elevated BNP levels were observed before completion of the Fontan circulation or when patients were symptomatic; a clear association between BNP and New York Heart Association functional class was demonstrated. In conclusion, this review shows an overall increase in BNP values in complex CHD, although differences between types of congenital heart anomaly are present.

A systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis were, therefore, undertaken to evaluate the available evidence from randomized trials. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erlotinib versus doublets (erlotinib plus another targeted agent) in advanced NSCLC and, if adequate data are available, to investigate whether or not predefined patient groups benefit more or less from doublet-targeted therapy based on erlotinib. Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. Randomized controlled clinical trials were conducted in which any erlotinib was compared with doublets based on erlotinib in patients with NSCLC who had failed to respond to any previous chemotherapy regimen. Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion in the review and extracted data. A systematic review and meta-analysis based on aggregate data extracted from trial publications were carried out to assess the effectiveness of doublets (erlotinib plus another targeted drug) in NSCLC treatment. The efficacy outcomes were objective response rate (ORR), complete response plus partial response; disease control rate (DCR), complete response plus partial response and stable disease; and 1-year overall survival (OS). The adverse effects (AEs) were also considered. This involved identifying eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and extracting aggregate data from the reports of these RCTs. Hazard ratios were calculated from published summary statistics and then combined to give pooled estimates of treatment efficacy. This meta-analysis comprised five studies including 2,100 patients (mean age 63; 1,224 men and 876 women; 118 stage IIIB and 1,180 stage IV; 441 squamous cell cancers, 1,287 adenocarcinomas, and 372 other pathological types). Doublets regimen significantly improved ORR [hazard ratio (HR) 1.49, 1.13-1.98, p\u2009<\u20090.05] and DCR (HR 1.25, 1.12-1.39, p\u2009<\u20090.05) compared with single erlotinib, but 1-year OS was not significantly improved for doublets [HR 1.06; 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI), 0.95-1.18]. All-grade rash, anemia, diarrhea, anorexia, and fatigue were not significantly different between doublet and erlotinib groups (HR 1.25, 0.99-1.58; 0.98, 0.78-1.24; 1.43, 0.97-2.11; 1.18, 0.84-1.65; and 1.23, 0.86-1.77, respectively). The total grade of \u22653 AEs was also not significantly different (HR 1.40, 95\u00a0% CI 0.97-2.01). Compared with single-agent erlotinib, doublets (erlotinib plus another targeted agent) significantly improve ORR and DCR, but not OS, and induce no significance of more frequent and serious AEs. The benefit-to-risk ratio of doublets in advanced NSCLC may be more favorable than that of single-agent. The results of this systematic review suggest that patients with advanced NSCLC might benefit from doublet-targeted therapy based on erlotinib compared to erlotinib alone.

The systematic review included randomized controlled trials from a systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, conference proceedings and registers of ongoing studies. Implementation strategies were shown to be effective with substantial heterogeneity of treatment effects across all investigated strategies. Primary aim of this study was to explain different effects of eligible trials and to identify methodological and clinical effect modifiers. Random effects meta-regression models were used to simultaneously assess the influence of multimodal implementation strategies and effect modifiers on physician adherence. Effect modifiers included the staff responsible for implementation, level of prevention and definition pf the primary outcome, unit of randomization, duration of follow-up and risk of bias. Six clinical and methodological factors were investigated as potential effect modifiers of the efficacy of different implementation strategies on guideline adherence in primary care practices on the basis of information from 75 eligible trials.

The aim of this evidence synthesis was to summarize the available evidence in order to update the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy. We conducted a systematic review and, where appropriate, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) carried out in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (six studies) or dysmetabolism (one study) to answer the following questions: What is the evidence that T2D is preventable by lifestyle changes? What is the optimal diet (with a particular focus on diet quality) for prevention, and does the prevention of T2D result in a lower risk of late complications of T2D? The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was applied to assess the certainty of the trial evidence. Altogether seven RCTs (N = 4090) fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The diagnosis of incident diabetes was based on an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The overall risk reduction of T2D by the lifestyle interventions was 0.53 (95% CI 0.41; 0.67). Most of the trials aimed to reduce weight, increase physical activity, and apply a diet relatively low in saturated fat and high in fiber. The PREDIMED trial that did not meet eligibility criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis was used in the final assessment of diet quality.

In the face of challenges such as HIV, Ebola, poverty, conflict and disaster the numbers have grown rather than reduced. Some countries have closed institutions down -driven by findings that cognitive developmental delay is associated with institutional care. Yet insight into abuse and violence within institutionalised settings is neglected. Maltreatment -violence and abuse -may be an issue. This systematic review series addresses violence and abuse experiences in institutionalised care, exploring firstly the frequency of abuse/violence in institutions, secondly any interventions to reduce such violence or abuse and thirdly the perpetrators of such violence or abuse. The final systematic review updates the findings on cognitive delay associated with institutionalised care. With a violence lens, cognitive delay may well be considered under the umbrella of neglect. Maltreatment and abuse may be a driver of cognitive delay. The keyword search covered several electronic databases and studies were included for data abstraction if they met adequacy criteria. Eight studies were identified on the prevalence of abuse in institutions and a further three studies reported on interventions. Only one study was identified documenting peer on peer violence in institutions. Sixty-six studies were identified examining cognitive development for institutionalised children. All but two of these record cognitive deficits associated with institutionalisation. Only two asked about violence or abuse which was found to be higher in institutionalised children. Overall the abuse experiences of children in institutions are poorly recorded, and in one study violence was associated with high suicidal attempts. The major intervention pathway for ameliorating cognitive challenge seems to be placement out of the institutions which shows benefits and redresses some cognitive outcomes - yet not a total panacea. The single study providing training and monitoring of harsh punishment and maltreatment showed immediate and decided reductions. This data suggest, despite the paucity of studies, violence and abuse, by commission or omission is prevalent in institutions, has an effect on child well-being and is amenable to intervention.

Several studies have shown how pharmacists have been contributing to reduce morbidity and mortality related to drug-therapy (MMRDT). However, there still is a lack of reviews that assemble evidence-based clinical pharmacists' counseling. Equally, there is also a need to understand structure characteristics, processes and technical contents of these clinical services. Aim of the review To review the structure, processes and technical contents of pharmacist counseling or education reported in randomized controlled trials (RCT) that had positive health-related outcomes. Methods We performed a systematic search in specialized databases to identify RCT published between 1990 and 2013 that have evaluated pharmacists' counseling or educational interventions to patients. Methodological quality of the trials was assessed using the Jadad scale. Pharmacists' interventions with positive clinical outcomes (p < 0.05) were evaluated according to patients' characteristics, setting and timing of intervention, reported written and verbal counseling. Results 753 studies were found and 101 RCT matched inclusion criteria. Most of the included RCTs showed a Jadad score between two (37 studies) and three (32 studies). Pharmacists were more likely to provide counseling at ambulatories (60 %) and hospital discharge (25 %); on the other hand pharmacists intervention were less likely to happen when dispensing a medication. Teaching back and explanations about the drug therapy purposes and precautions related to its use were often reported in RCT, whereas few studies used reminder charts, diaries, group or electronic counseling. Most of studies reported the provision of a printed material (letter, leaflet or medication record card), regarding accessible contents and cultural-concerned informations about drug therapy and disease. Conclusion Pharmacist counseling is an intervention directed to patients' health-related needs that improve inter-professional and inter-institutional communication, by collaborating to integrate health services.

In keeping with this view, the targeting of interleukin-6 with the human monoclonal antibody sirukumab may represent a possible treatment and disease modification approach, for adults with brain-based disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder). A PubMed/Medline database search was performed using the following search terms: sirukumab; anti-IL-6; IL-6; major depressive disorder; inflammation. A systematic review was conducted of both preclinical and clinical trials reporting on the pharmacology of sirukumab or investigating the efficacy of targeting IL-6 signaling. Overall, sirukumab has been reported to be a safe and well-tolerated agent, capable of modulating the immune response in healthy populations as well as in subjects with inflammatory disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Sirukumab's effects on cytokine networks as part of the innate immune system provide a coherent rationale for possible application in neuropsychiatric disorders with possible benefits across several domains of the biobehavioral Research Domain Criteria matrix (e.g., general cognitive processes, positive valence systems). Amongst individuals with complex brain-based disorders (e.g., mood disorders), the dimensions/domains most likely to benefit with sirukumab are negative valence disturbances (e.g., anxiety, depression, rumination), positive valence disturbances (e.g., anhedonia) as well as general cognitive processes.

Studies investigating consequences of hypokalemia after acute myocardial infarction revealed conflicting results. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to combine evidence from previous studies on the association of serum potassium concentration with both short and long-term mortality as well as the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods A structured search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases yielded 23 articles published between 1990 and January 2017 that met the inclusion criteria. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were carried out by three reviewers. Random effects models were used to pool estimates across the included studies and sensitivity analyses were performed when possible. Results Twelve studies were included in the meta-analysis. Both pooled results from six studies investigating short-term mortality and from five studies examining long-term mortality revealed significantly increased risks in patients with serum potassium concentrations of <3.5\u2009mEq/L, 4.5-<5.0\u2009mEq/L and \u22655.0\u2009mEq/L after acute myocardial infarction. In addition, a serum potassium concentration of <3.5\u2009mEq/L was significantly associated with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. Conclusions Mortality, both short and long term, and the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with acute myocardial infarction seem to be negatively associated with hypokalemic serum potassium concentration. There is evidence for adverse consequences of serum potassium concentrations of \u22654.5\u2009mEq/L.

PA subtypes include aerobic, resistance, flexibility, neuromotor (involving balance, agility and co-ordination), mind-body (e.g. tai chi, qi gong and yoga) and mixed type trainings. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that PA subtypes can have positive clinical effects, however the effects on the symptomatology may vary according to the PA subtype. It therefore stands to reason that various PA subtypes may modulate the immune system and neuroplastic processes differently. This systematic review aims to assess the immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles of various PA subtypes, particularly in unipolar depression and age-related cognitive decline (ARCD). The literature suggests several unique immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles for PA subtypes (i.e. resistance, aerobic and mind-body) in depression and ARCD. In depression, levels of various cytokines at baseline may predict treatment response to subtypes of PA and pharmacological agents. The pro-neuroplastic effects of resistance and aerobic PA in ARCD may differ due to variances in neurotrophin profiles. At this stage of literature in the field, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the specific immunomodulatory and neuroplastic pathways involved in these PA subtypes given of the small number of comparative studies and methodological heterogeneity between studies (e.g. study population age and illness severity, as well as duration and intensity of PA intervention).

One hundred and two studies were identified, of which 33 were eligible. Two authors independently extracted data including study design, participants, and results. Results indicated that women with symptoms of PPA are less likely to breastfeed exclusively and more likely to terminate breastfeeding earlier. Some evidence also suggests that those experiencing PPA are less likely to initiate breastfeeding and more likely to supplement with formula in the hospital. In those who do breastfeed, PPA reduces self-efficacy, increases breastfeeding difficulties, and may negatively affect breastfeeding behaviors and breast milk composition. Heterogeneous outcomes and methodological limitations somewhat limit the comparability of findings. However, in combination with a review linking depression with similar negative infant-feeding sequelae, the findings provide evidence for the effect of negative postpartum mood on breastfeeding. Additional support for breastfeeding mothers with PPA is warranted."}, "pico": {"P": "Postpartum women with symptoms of anxiety", "I": "Presence of postpartum anxiety", "C": "Absence of postpartum anxiety", "O": "Infant-feeding outcomes such as exclusive breastfeeding, duration of breastfeeding, initiation of breastfeeding, supplementation with formula, self-efficacy, breastfeeding difficulties, breastfeeding behaviors, and breast milk composition"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00360204"], "pub_date": "2016/11/01"}

However, a large amount of variation exists in its efficacy. Sex of participants and exercise type are two possible factors contributing to this variation. To better understand this, we conducted a concurrent systematic review and meta-analysis of cognitively healthy older adults. Executive functions, episodic memory, visuospatial function, word fluency, processing speed and global cognitive function were examined for exercise- and sex-dependent effects. For executive functions, three types of exercise interventions - aerobic training, resistance training, and multimodal training (i.e., both aerobic and resistance training) - were associated with larger effect sizes in studies comprised of a higher percentage of women compared to studies with a lower percentage of women. This suggests that women's executive processes may benefit more from exercise than men. Regardless of sex, compared to control, all three exercise training approaches enhanced visuospatial function, but only multimodal training enhanced episodic memory.

Depression is an independent risk factor for mortality in cardiovascular samples. Neuroendocrine dysfunctions in MDD are related to an overactive hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and increased sympathetic activity. Novel intervention strategies for MDD include the non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In fact, although these techniques have being increasingly used as a treatment for MDD, their cardiovascular effects were not sufficiently investigated, which would be important considering the dyad MDD/cardiovascular disorders. We investigated this issue through a systematic review for published articles from the first date available to May 2012 in MEDLINE and other databases, looking for main risk factors and surrogate markers for cardiovascular disease such as: cortisol, heart rate variability (HRV), alcohol, smoking, obesity, hypertension, glucose. We identified 37 articles (981 subjects) according to our eligibility criteria. Our main findings were that NIBS techniques might be effective strategies for down-regulating HPA activity and regulating food, alcohol, and cigarette consumption. NIBS's effects on HRV and blood pressure presented mixed findings, with studies suggesting that HRV values can decrease or remain unchanged after NIBS, while one study found that rTMS increased blood pressure levels. Also, a single study showed that glucose levels decrease after tDCS.

The use of prophylactic antibiotics is empirical as most surgeons fear complications associated with the same. No systematic review has been performed in English on the role of intravitreal/intracameral antibiotics in preventing traumatic endophthalmitis.

Quality of the trials was assessed using Cochrane collaboration tools to assess the risk of bias. The main outcome measures were endophthalmitis and visual acuity. We included three trials. Overall, intravitreal/intracameral antibiotics were noted to significantly reduce the occurrence of endophthalmitis in open globe injuries (relative risk [RR] 0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06-0.57). The use of intravitreal/intracameral antibiotics did not have an effect in improving visual acuity (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.61-2.23).

Globally, we identified uncertainty with regard to the association of the evaluated biomarkers with stroke outcome, with little added value on top of clinical predictors such as age or stroke severity, which makes its implementation unlikely in clinical practice for global outcome prediction. Regarding poststroke complications, despite being more practical scenarios in which to make medical decisions following a biomarker prediction, not many studies have been performed, although there are now some candidates for prediction of poststroke infections.

Evidence from a systematic review.", "abstract": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a worldwide public health problem. Many proposals aiming to eliminate its occurrence include the empowerment of women through their socio-economic development. In this context, some studies suggested that microcredit programs (MP) and cash transfer programs (CTP) are initiatives that can also reduce the risk of IPV. Others pointed to an opposite effect. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of women's economic empowerment in MP and CTP on the risk of physical, psychological and sexual violence through a systematic review. Papers/documents selection was conducted by two researchers according to the following criteria: published in English, Portuguese or Spanish; primary data; assessing the effect of MP or CTP on IPV; in heterosexual couples; on women beneficiaries of the intervention; using a comparator group eligible for an MP or CTP; and focusing on risk IPV as the outcomes. Our results showed that the impact of MP are mixed when it comes to physical and physical/sexual violence. Even so, the review suggests that the effect of MP on sexual violence is trivial or nonexistent. Regarding the impact of CTPs, the present study showed that the effects on physical, physical/sexual, psychological, and sexual violence were also heterogeneous. Women more empowered and with some autonomy could be at risk. Despite that, participation in the empowerment program should be encouraged for poor women and families.

However, it is not known whether these measures are effective in reducing colonisation and infection. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of patient-level interventions for the prevention of colonisation with MDR-GNB and whether these interventions are associated with a reduction in the rate of infection due to MDR-GNB in the intensive care unit. Searches were conducted on PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE and World of Science databases to identify comparative interventional studies on patient-level interventions implemented in the intensive care unit. Literature published in English, Spanish or French from January 1, 2000, until April 30, 2013, was searched. A total of 631 reports were found and we included and analysed 13 comparative studies that reported outcomes for an intervention compared with a control group. There were ten randomised and three observational interventional trials evaluating seven interventions. Overall, there was a reduction in colonisation (odds ratio [OR] 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66 to 0.85) and infection (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.75) with MDR-GNB.

We identified a significant reduction in MDR-GNB colonisation and infection through the use of patient-level interventions.

In China, irrational uses of blood have often been reported in recent years. However, to date there lacks a systematic review of the rational uses of blood. This study aimed to determine the clinical appropriateness of blood transfusion in China. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database, WanFang Database, and Chinese BioMedical Literature Database, and the retrieval cut-off date was June 31, 2015. SPSS 17.0 and MetaAnalyst 3.13 were employed as the statistics tools in this review. A pooled rate of clinical inappropriateness of transfusion was analyzed by DerSimonian-Laird method. In this study, a total of 39 observational studies were included, which related to 75,132 cases of blood transfusion. According to the meta-analysis results, the overall incidence of clinical inappropriateness of transfusion in China was estimated to be 37.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] [32.1, 42.8]). The subgroup analyses revealed that the pooled rates of clinical inappropriateness of transfusion of plasma, red blood cells (RBCs), cryoprecipitate, and platelets were 56.3% (95% CI [45.8, 66.2]), 30.9% (95% CI [27.1, 35.0]), 25.2% (95% CI [13.2, 42.7]), and 14.1% (95% CI [8.8, 21.9]), respectively. However, the pooled incidence of inappropriateness of transfusion in operative departments was 47.5% (95% CI [36.8, 58.3]), which was significantly higher than that in nonoperative departments, 25.8% (95% CI [18.7, 34.4], P\u200a<\u200a0.05). The overall rates of inappropriate use were 36.7% (95% CI [30.2, 43.6]) in major cities and 37.5% (95% CI [31.2, 44.3]) in other cities, respectively; there was no statistically significant difference (P\u200a>\u200a0.05).

Major databases were systematically searched for all relevant studies published in English up to June 2019. Eighteen randomized controlled trials including 1844 patients were enrolled.

No difference was observed between the dosing strategies in the proportion of patients with clinical remission (relative risk [RR] 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-1.10), clinical improvement (RR 0.87 95% CI 0.68-1.10), or relapse at 6 (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.83-1.46) or 12 months (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.83-1.03).
