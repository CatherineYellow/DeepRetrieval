Therefore, a consensus statement for state-of-the-art exercise prescription in patients with combinations of CVD risk factors as integrated into a digital training and decision support system (the EXercise Prescription in Everyday practice & Rehabilitative Training (EXPERT) tool) needed to be established. EXPERT working group members systematically reviewed the literature for meta-analyses, systematic reviews and/or clinical studies addressing exercise prescriptions in specific CVD risk factors and formulated exercise recommendations (exercise training intensity, frequency, volume and type, session and programme duration) and exercise safety precautions, for obesity, arterial hypertension, type 1 and 2 diabetes, and dyslipidaemia. The impact of physical fitness, CVD risk altering medications and adverse events during exercise testing was further taken into account to fine-tune this exercise prescription. An algorithm, supported by the interactive EXPERT tool, was developed by Hasselt University based on these data. Specific exercise recommendations were formulated with the aim to decrease adipose tissue mass, improve glycaemic control and blood lipid profile, and lower blood pressure. The impact of medications to improve CVD risk, adverse events during exercise testing and physical fitness was also taken into account. Simulations were made of how the EXPERT tool provides exercise prescriptions according to the variables provided. In this paper, state-of-the-art exercise prescription to patients with combinations of CVD risk factors is formulated, and it is shown how the EXPERT tool may assist clinicians.

Thanks to advances in new forms of cognitive behavioral therapy (known as third-wave CBT), currently clinicians and researchers have an empirically validated psychological treatment with increasing research support for the treatment of chronic pain. This treatment is called acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). The main aim of this paper is to provide a narrative review that summarizes and integrates the current state of knowledge of ACT in the management of chronic pain as well as discuss current challenges and opportunities for progress. Based on the psychological flexibility model, ACT extends previous forms of CBT and integrates many CBT-related variables into six core therapeutic processes. ACT is a process-based therapy that fosters openness, awareness, and engagement through a wide range of methods, including exposure-based and experiential methods, metaphors, and values clarification. To our knowledge, there are three published systematic reviews and meta-analyses that support the effectiveness of ACT for chronic pain and many studies focused on specific processes derived from the psychological flexibility model. There is also promising support for the cost-effectiveness of ACT; however, the current evidence is still insufficient to establish firm conclusions about cost-effectiveness and the most efficient means of delivery. Additional well-designed economic evaluations are needed.

This study aimed to identify the practice of key opinion leaders performing randomised clinical trials involving endovenous ablation. Method A systematic review of MEDLINE/EMBASE/CENTRAL was performed identifying the compression strategies used in randomised clinical trials where at least one comparator arm underwent endovenous ablation. Results Thirty-four randomised clinical trials were identified. At least 14 different compression products were used, with at least 6 different pressures in 7 different regimes with durations from 2 to 84 days. There was no evidence of any convergence of practice over time. Conclusions A lack of evidence as to the optimal strategy for compression has resulted in a marked variation in clinical practice.

This review, conducted with both PubMed and EMBASE, was used to update an earlier one undertaken on 30 June 2010 using the same search string. Eligible publications included those that had outcome measures reported for both a treated and a control population that were managed either at the same time, or as part of a before-and-after case design.

The identified articles included 37 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three cohort studies with concurrent controls, and included studies on the use of surgical procedures, topical antiseptics, negative pressure wound therapy and hyperbaric oxygen. Among the studies were 15 RCTs that compared outcomes of treatment with new antibiotic preparations compared with a conventional therapy in the management of skin and soft tissue infection. In addition, 10 RCTs and 1 cohort study compared different treatments for osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot. Results of comparisons of different antibiotic regimens generally demonstrated that newly introduced antibiotic regimens appeared to be as effective as conventional therapy (and also more cost-effective in one study), but one study failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of a new antibiotic compared with that of a standard agent. Overall, the available literature was both limited in both the number of studies and the quality of their design.

Random-effects meta-analyses were undertaken to calculate proportional data and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for motivating factors and barriers toward exercise. From 1468 studies, 12 independent studies of 6431 psychiatric patients were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analyses showed that 91% of people with SMI endorsed 'improving health' as a reason for exercise (N = 6, n = 790, 95% CI 80-94). Among specific aspects of health and well-being, the most common motivations were 'losing weight' (83% of patients), 'improving mood' (81%) and 'reducing stress' (78%). However, low mood and stress were also identified as the most prevalent barriers towards exercise (61% of patients), followed by 'lack of support' (50%). Many of the desirable outcomes of exercise for people with SMI, such as mood improvement, stress reduction and increased energy, are inversely related to the barriers of depression, stress and fatigue which frequently restrict their participation in exercise. Providing patients with professional support to identify and achieve their exercise goals may enable them to overcome psychological barriers, and maintain motivation towards regular physical activity."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with severe mental illness", "I": "Motivating factors and barriers towards exercise", "C": "N/A", "O": "Exercise participation, reasons for exercise, barriers to exercise"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00331305"]}

Associations with cardiovascular outcomes and skipping breakfast in adults have been reported. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the association of skipping breakfast with body weight and metabolic outcomes in the pediatric population. We searched relevant databases (2008\u207b2018) and identified 56 articles, of which 39 were suitable to be included, basing on inclusion criteria (observational; defined breakfast skipping; weight and/or metabolic outcomes). Overall, 286,804 children and adolescents living in 33 countries were included. The definitions of OW/OB, skipping breakfast, and the nutrient assessment were highly heterogeneous. Confounding factors were reported infrequently. The prevalence of skipping breakfast ranged 10\u207b30%, with an increasing trend in adolescents, mainly in girls. Skipping breakfast was associated with OW/OB in the 94.7% of the subjects. The lack of association was shown mainly in infants. Moreover, 16,130 subjects were investigated for cardiometabolic outcomes. Skipping breakfast was associated with a worse lipid profile, blood pressure levels, insulin-resistance, and metabolic syndrome. Five studies reported a lower quality dietary intake in breakfast skippers. This review supports skipping breakfast as an easy marker of the risk of OW/OB and metabolic diseases, whether or not it is directly involved in causality. We encourage intervention studies using standardized and generalizable indicators.

There might be an optimal dietary fat to carbohydrate ratio for prevention and treatment of obesity. According to the Japanese Dietary Reference Intakes (RDA) for 2010, the optimal fat intake is 20-30% of energy for ages 1-29 y and 20-25% for ages 30 y and over. Upper boundary values of this recommendation were the median of the percentage of energy from dietary fat in Japanese. In a systematic review to estimate the optimal dietary fat to carbohydrate ratio, it was found that obese subjects with hyperinsulinemia (or insulin resistance) lost more weight on a mild low-carbohydrate (LC) (or low-glycemic load diet; 40% carbohydrate, 30-35% fat) than on a low-fat (LF) diet (55-60% carbohydrate, 20% fat), whereas those without hyperinsulinemia showed the opposite. In non-obese primarily insulin-sensitive subjects, decreasing fat rather than carbohydrate intake is generally more effective to prevent obesity. Physiological and molecular evidence supports this conclusion. Increased carbohydrate intake, especially in high-glycemic food, leads to postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, which are exaggerated in obese insulin-resistant subjects. Even in an insulin-resistant state, insulin is able to stimulate fatty acid synthesis in liver, activate lipoprotein lipase, and prevent lipolysis in adipose tissues, which all facilitate adipose tissue enlargement. Optimal dietary fat to carbohydrate ratio may differ in populations depending on their prevalence for obesity. Because the prevalence of overweight/obesity in Japanese is low, a LF diet is recommended in the general population."}, "pico": {"P": "Japanese population with varying levels of obesity and insulin sensitivity", "I": "Optimal dietary fat to carbohydrate ratio (e.g., low-fat vs. low-carbohydrate diet)", "C": "Comparison of different dietary fat to carbohydrate ratios", "O": "Weight loss, insulin sensitivity, prevention of obesity, metabolic markers"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00000611", "NCT00130299", "NCT00327821", "NCT00254215"]}

The included studies that examined the improvement of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, inflammation, metabolic syndromes, digestive function, and colorectal cancer's markers were consistently supported, whereas other expected functions were relatively controversial. Nevertheless, only 43 clinical trials (39.4%) met the criterion of having a 'high quality of evidence.'

Medline, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and abstracts from the American Society of Hematology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of either induction or maintenance thalidomide in adults with previously untreated myeloma. Nine RCTs of induction thalidomide, three RCTs of maintenance thalidomide, and one RCT of induction and maintenance thalidomide were identified, involving a total of 4144 subjects. When thalidomide was added to standard, non-transplantation myeloma therapy, overall survival (OS) improved (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.56-0.81). When thalidomide was given as maintenance following autologous transplantation (ASCT), there was a trend to improved OS (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37-1.01); when the only trial which combined induction and maintenance thalidomide was excluded from this analysis, a significant survival advantage emerged (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.32-0.74).

Exploring the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and overweight/obesity is complex, and there are important methodological differences and limitations in the studies that make it difficult to compare results. Although the results are inconsistent, the evidence points towards a possible role of the Mediterranean diet in preventing overweight/obesity, and physiological mechanisms can explain this protective effect.

The objective of the systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of injury prevention neuromuscular training strategies in youth sport. Three electronic databases were systematically searched up to September 2014. Studies selected met the following criteria: original data; analytic prospective design; investigated a neuromuscular training prevention strategy intervention(s) and included outcomes for injury sustained during sport participation. Two authors assessed the quality of evidence using Downs and Black (DB) criteria. Meta-analyses including randomised controlled trials only (RCTs) to ensure study design homogeneity were completed for lower extremity and knee injury outcomes.

Meta-analysis revealed a combined preventative effect of neuromuscular training in reducing the risk of lower extremity injury (incidence rate ratio: IRR=0.64 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.84)). Though not statistically significant, the point estimate suggests a protective effect of such programmes in reducing the risk of knee injury (IRR=0.74 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.07)).

We found no study reporting on caries-related hospitalizations. At the individual level, the pooled relative risk was 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81, 0.95); this means that in a population of preschool children with 50% caries incidence, we need to apply fluoride varnish in 17 children to avoid new caries in one child.

The applicants challenged a government decision to offer Nevirapine in a few pilot sites when evidence showed Nevirapine significantly reduced HIV transmission rates and despite donor offers of a free supply. The government refused to expand access, arguing they needed to collect more information, and citing concerns about long-term hazards, side effects, resistance and inadequate infrastructure. The court ruled this violated children's right to health and asked the government to immediately expand access. Cluster randomized trials involving children are increasingly popular, and are often used to reduce 'contamination': the possibility that members of a cluster adopt behavior of other clusters. However, they raise unique issues insufficiently addressed in literature and ethical guidelines. This case provides additional crucial guidance, based on a common human rights framework, for the Kenyan government and other involved stakeholders. Children possess special rights, often represent a 'captive' group, and so motivate extra consideration. In a systematic review, we therefore investigated whether cluster trial designs are used to prevent or delay children's access to treatment in Kenya or otherwise inconsistently with children's right to health as outlined in the above case. Although we did not find state sponsored cluster trials, most had significant public sector involvement. Core obligations under children's right to health were inadequately addressed across trials. Few cluster trials reported rationale for cluster randomization, offered post- trial access or planned to implement successful interventions. A small number of trials may have unnecessarily evaluated proven interventions, offered their control arm trial conditions worse than local standards of care or evaluated interventions ostensibly worse than local standards of care. Further research is required to establish if children's right to health in cluster trials is well understood and to explain why some obligations are unmet."}, "pico": {"P": "Children in Kenya participating in cluster randomized trials", "I": "Cluster randomized trial designs affecting children's right to health", "C": "Standard care or alternative trial conditions", "O": "Impact on children's access to treatment, adherence to children's right to health, and ethical considerations in cluster randomized trials"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT01088958"]}

In the search for food compounds able to ameliorate this condition, it has been postulated that n-3 Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA), also known as omega-3, consumption could have a positive effect in the prevention or therapy of these cognitive declines. However, there are contradictory findings in the literature concerning the effects of n-3 LCPUFA on cognitive decline making it difficult to draw a conclusion on this topic. This current systematic review studies the relationship between n-3 LCPUFAs and cognitive status in aged adult and elder populations to determine whether there is or not a positive effect of n-3 LCPUFAs supplementation on cognitive decline. Additionally, we remark how duration periods, different cognitive baseline status in subjects, dosage of n-3 LCPUFAs administration and the presence of other factors might be related to different outcomes. A search of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related with the relationship between cognitive impairment and n-3 LCPUFA (docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentanoic acid or combined) supplementation was conducted through PubMed database from January 2010 to December 2017 following the PRISMA statement.

Omitting nitrous oxide significantly reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting (pooled relative risk 0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.90, p = 0.0003). However, the absolute incidence of nausea and vomiting was high in both the nitrous oxide and no-nitrous oxide groups (33% vs 27%, respectively). In subgroup analysis, the maximal risk reduction was obtained in female patients (pooled relative risk 0.76, 95% CI 0.60-0.96). When nitrous oxide was used in combination with propofol, the antiemetic effect of the latter appeared to compensate the emetogenic effect of nitrous oxide (pooled relative risk 0.94, 95% CI 0.77-1.15).

Macrolides and statins exert a broad range of anti-inflammatory effects.

The weight of several retrospective studies suggests that statins be considered in treating acute CAP. Further support for the use of statins derives from the high association between pneumonia and acute myocardial infarction. Aspirin might also be of benefit in treating patients hospitalized for pneumonia because of its anti-inflammatory activity as well as its benefits in acute myocardial infarction.

The World Health Organization guidelines for pharmacological treatments for children's persisting pain acknowledge that pain in children is a major public health concern of high significance in most parts of the world. While in the past, pain was largely dismissed and was frequently left untreated, views on children's pain have changed over time, and relief of pain is now seen as importantWe designed a suite of seven reviews on chronic non-cancer pain and cancer pain (looking at antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and paracetamol as priority areas) in order to review the evidence for children's pain utilising pharmacological interventions in children and adolescents.As the leading cause of morbidity in children and adolescents in the world today, chronic disease (and its associated pain) is a major health concern. Chronic pain (lasting three months or longer) can arise in the paediatric population in a variety of pathophysiological classifications: nociceptive, neuropathic, idiopathic, visceral, nerve damage pain, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and chronic abdominal pain, and other unknown reasons.Opioids are used worldwide for the treatment of pain. They bind to opioid receptors in the central nervous system (mu, kappa, delta, and sigma) and can be agonists, antagonists, mixed agonist-antagonists, or partial agonists. Opioids are generally available in healthcare settings across most high-income countries, but access may be restricted in low- and middle-income countries. For example, opioids currently available in the UK include: buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol. Opioids are used in varying doses (generally based on body weight for paediatric patients) by means of parenteral, transmucosal, transdermal, or oral administration (immediate release or modified release).

Recently, the study of the role of microRNA (miRNA) in the pathogenesis of HBV has gained considerable interest as well as new treatments against this pathogen have been approved. A few studies have investigated the antiviral activity of vitamin E (VE) in chronic HBV carriers. Herein, we review the possible role of tocopherols in the modulation of host miRNA with potential anti-HBV activity. A systematic research of the scientific literature was performed by searching the MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and EMBASE databases. The keywords used were 'HBV therapy', 'HBV treatment', 'VE antiviral effects', 'tocopherol antiviral activity', 'miRNA antiviral activity' and 'VE microRNA'. Reports describing the role of miRNA in the regulation of HBV life cycle, in vitro and in vivo available studies reporting the effects of VE on miRNA expression profiles and epigenetic networks, and clinical trials reporting the use of VE in patients with HBV-related chronic hepatitis were identified and examined. Based on the clinical results obtained in VE-treated chronic HBV carriers, we provide a reliable hypothesis for the possible role of this vitamin in the modulation of host miRNA profiles perturbed by this viral pathogen and in the regulation of some cellular miRNA with a suggested potential anti-HBV activity.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated its safety in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE); however, the evidence is unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the role of EPO in perinatal HIE by a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Database search included Embase, MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). RCTs reporting a death, neurodevelopmental outcomes or brain injury were included. Two authors extracted the data independently from included studies and assessed the level of evidence (LOE). Results Six RCTs (EPO=5 and darbepoetin \u03b1=1) involving 454 neonates were included. A trend toward a lower risk of death was identified in infants treated with EPO [EPO with or without hypothermia: five RCTs, 368 participants, relative risk (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-1.19, LOE-low; EPO without hypothermia: four RCTs, 318 participants, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.49-1.32, LOE-low]. EPO treatment without hypothermia compared to placebo resulted in a reduced risk of cerebral palsy (two RCTs, 230 participants, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27-0.80, LOE-moderate) and moderate to severe cognitive impairment (two RCTs, 226 participants, RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28-0.85, LOE-moderate). A reduced risk of brain injury was identified in EPO treated infants (EPO with or without hypothermia, two RCTs, 148 participants, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.92, LOE-moderate).

A systematic review was performed to evaluate the relationship between coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden changes measured by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and CVD outcomes. Research design and methods Rigorous systematic review methodology was used to identify prospective studies of any design assessing the relationship between atherosclerotic plaque volume (percentage or total atheroma volume [PAV or TAV]) changes and CVD outcomes, using multivariable analyses. Main outcome measures CVD outcomes including major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs). Results Literature searches from inception to February 2015 retrieved 6958 records after de-duplication. From these four studies (14 papers) were included. One study reported a significantly lower rate of CVD outcomes associated with a greater reduction in PAV (hazard ratio [HR] 0.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.83). One study reported that large plaque volume was significantly associated with a greater risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) (HR 1.73, 95% CI: 1.02-2.96). Similarly, a third study reported a significant increase in MACE with an increase in baseline PAV (HR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.06-2.51). Only one potentially inadequately powered Japanese study did not find a statistically significant relationship between PAV changes and MACE. Conclusions The current evidence suggests an independent and statistically significant association between increases in coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden measured by IVUS and greater long-term risk of future CVD outcomes.

There has been considerable effort for several decades toward the development of a vaccine against the disease. Numerous mouse experimental studies using attenuated Schistosoma mansoni parasites for vaccination have been published since 1960s. However, to date, there has been no systematic review or meta-analysis of these data. The aim of this study is to identify measurable experimental conditions that affect the level of protection against re-infection with S. mansoni in mice vaccinated with radiation attenuated cercariae. Following a systematic review, a total of 755 observations were extracted from 105 articles (published 1963-2007) meeting the searching criteria. Random effects meta-regression models were used to identify the influential predictors. Three predictors were found to have statistically significant effects on the level of protection from vaccination: increasing numbers of immunizing parasites had a positive effect on fraction of protection whereas increasing radiation dose and time to challenge infection had negative effects. Models showed that the irradiated cercariae vaccine has the potential to achieve protection as high as 78% with a single dose vaccination. This declines slowly over time but remains high for at least 8\u2009months after the last immunization. These findings provide insights into the optimal delivery of attenuated parasite vaccination and into the nature and development of protective vaccine induced immunity against schistosomiasis, which may inform the formulation of human vaccines and the predicted duration of protection and thus frequency of booster vaccines."}, "pico": {"P": "Mice vaccinated with radiation attenuated cercariae", "I": "Vaccination with radiation attenuated cercariae", "C": "Not specified", "O": "Level of protection against re-infection with S. mansoni"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00215267", "NCT01441167", "NCT00757887", "NCT01001650"]}

This systematic review and meta-analysis using individual patient-level data was conducted to better assess the efficacy and safety of this strategy in patients with early breast cancer. Methods The trials in which premenopausal women with early breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy alone or with concurrent GnRHa were eligible for inclusion. Primary end points were premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) rate and post-treatment pregnancy rate. Disease-free survival and overall survival were secondary end points. Because each study represents a cluster, statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model. Results A total of 873 patients from five trials were included.

To review the current literature, determine gaps in our knowledge, and identify areas in need of further investigation, we conducted a systematic review of studies examining depression and anxiety symptoms among children with JIA and the impact these symptoms may have on disease outcomes and quality of life. Six electronic databases were searched up until January 2019.

We found that JIA patients experience symptoms of depression and anxiety similar to other childhood chronic diseases and at higher rates than in healthy children. Patients who experience these symptoms have worse quality of life, with some evidence pointing to depression and anxiety symptoms having a greater impact on quality of life than other disease features, such as active joint count. Family members of JIA patients experience high rates of anxiety and depression symptoms which may impact their child's mental health and pain symptoms related to JIA.

The primary aim of the proposed study is to determine the effect of aerobic exercise training (AEX) on the VE/VCO2 slope and NTproBNP. The following databases (up to February 30, 2013) were searched with no language limitations: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, issue 2), MEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January 1980), and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) (from January 1929). We screened reference lists of articles and also conducted an extensive hand search of the literature. Randomized controlled trials of exercise-based interventions with 2-month follow-up or longer compared to usual medical care or placebo were included. The study population comprised adults aged between 18 and 65\u00a0years, with evidence of chronic systolic heart failure (LVEF\u00a0<\u00a045\u00a0% and baseline NTproBNP\u00a0>\u00a0300\u00a0pg/ml). Two review authors independently extracted data on study design, participants, interventions, and outcomes. We assessed the risk of bias using PEDro scale. We calculated mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences between intervention and control groups for outcomes with sufficient data; for other outcomes, we described findings from individual studies. Eight studies involving a total of 408 participants met the inclusion criteria across the NTproBNP (5 studies with 191 patients) and VE/VCO2 slope (4 studies with 217 patients). Aerobic exercise significantly improved NTproBNP by a MD of -817.75 [95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) -929.31 to -706.19]. Mean differences across VE/VCO2 slope were -6.55 (95\u00a0% CI -7.24 to -5.87).

Moreover, the risk of bias across all studies was homogeneous (PEDro scale\u00a0=\u00a07-8 points). However, based on the statistical analysis, the heterogeneity among the studies was still high, which is related to the variable characteristics of the studies. Aerobic exercise may be effective at improving NTproBNP and the VE/VCO2 slope in systolic HF patients, but these effects are limited to a specific HF population meeting specific inclusion criterion in a limited number of studies.

Exercise has been reported as one of the best non-pharmacological ways to improve bone mass throughout life. However, not all exercise regimens have the same positive effects on bone mass, and the studies that have evaluated the role of exercise programmes on bone-related variables in elderly people have obtained inconclusive results. This systematic review aims to summarize and update present knowledge about the effects of different types of training programmes on bone mass in older adults and elderly people as a starting point for developing future interventions that maintain a healthy bone mass and higher quality of life in people throughout their lifetime. A literature search using MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases was conducted and bibliographies for studies discussing the effect of exercise interventions in older adults published up to August 2011 were examined. Inclusion criteria were met by 59 controlled trials, 7 meta-analyses and 8 reviews. The studies included in this review indicate that bone-related variables can be increased, or at least the common decline in bone mass during ageing attenuated, through following specific training programmes. Walking provides a modest increase in the loads on the skeleton above gravity and, therefore, this type of exercise has proved to be less effective in osteoporosis prevention. Strength exercise seems to be a powerful stimulus to improve and maintain bone mass during the ageing process. Multi-component exercise programmes of strength, aerobic, high impact and/or weight-bearing training, as well as whole-body vibration (WBV) alone or in combination with exercise, may help to increase or at least prevent decline in bone mass with ageing, especially in postmenopausal women. This review provides, therefore, an overview of intervention studies involving training and bone measurements among older adults, especially postmenopausal women. Some novelties are that WBV training is a promising alternative to prevent bone fractures and osteoporosis. Because this type of exercise under prescription is potentially safe, it may be considered as a low impact alternative to current methods combating bone deterioration. In other respects, the ability of peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) to assess bone strength and geometric properties may prove advantageous in evaluating the effects of training on bone health. As a result of changes in bone mass becoming evident by pQCT even when dual energy X-ray absortiometry (DXA) measurements were unremarkable, pQCT may provide new knowledge about the effects of exercise on bone that could not be elucidated by DXA. Future research is recommended including longest-term exercise training programmes, the addition of pQCT measurements to DXA scanners and more trials among men, including older participants."}, "pico": {"P": "Older adults and elderly people", "I": "Different types of training programmes (strength, aerobic, high impact, weight-bearing, whole-body vibration)", "C": "No specific comparison group mentioned", "O": "Increase or maintenance of bone mass, prevention of decline in bone mass, improvement in bone-related variables, potential prevention of bone fractures and osteoporosis, assessment of bone strength and geometric properties"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00267839"]}

Previous studies have shown that the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (DPP4i), such as sitagliptin, might reduce the incidence of major cardiovascular events (MACEs). However, the safety and efficacy of sitagliptin remains controversial, especially the safety for cardiovascular related events. Here, a systematic review was conducted to assess the cardiovascular safety of sitagliptin in T2DM patients. The literature research dating up to October 2018 was performed in the electronic database. The clinical trials about sitagliptin for T2DM patients were included. Two reviewers independently screened literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary outcome was the MACE, and the secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. Finally, 32 clinical trials composed of 16082 T2DM patients were included in this meta-analysis.

Following PRISMA guidelines, we used structured methods to search, screen, and extract data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies reporting quantitative outcomes of acceptability of the VR for any indication published 1/1970-2/2019 (PROSPERO: CRD42019122220).

PDN is known to affect both mental and physical wellbeing, resulting in anxiety, depression, low quality of life and physical disability. Pharmacological treatment of PDN aims at pain relief and is often ineffective and/or has many side effects. Rehabilitation treatment modalities that are designed to help the patient deal with PDN related complaints, are mostly focussed on either physical (e.g. exercise therapy) or psychological aspects (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, CBT). There is emerging evidence that PDN can be approached from a biopsychosocial perspective, in which physical and psychosocial aspects are integrated. From this biopsychosocial approach it is plausible that integrated treatment modalities such as acceptance commitment therapy (ACT) or exposure in vivo (EXP) could be effective in patients with PDN. The objective of this review was to provide an overview of the current evidence on the effects of rehabilitation treatments that combine exercise therapies with psychological therapies in order to improve physical activity (PA) and quality of life (QoL) in patients with PDN. Methods Systematic review of the current literature. EMBASE, MEDLINE, Medline In-Process citations and e-Pubs ahead-of-print, Pedro, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched. All studies on interventions combining exercise therapy with psychological interventions in patients with PDN, aged >18 years, were included. Outcome measures were PA, QoL. Results The search resulted in 1603 records after removing duplicates. After screening on titles and abstracts, 100 records remained. From these, not one study reported on interventions that combined exercise therapy with psychological interventions. Through a secondary hand search, a total of three reviews were identified that described a total of five studies regarding either physical or psychological interventions in patients with PDN. These studies reported moderate effects of (1) mindfulness meditation on QoL, (2) CBT on pain severity, (3) mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention on function, health-related QoL, pain catastrophizing and depression, (4) aerobic exercise on QoL and (5) Tai Chi on glucose control, balance, neuropathic symptoms, and some dimensions of QoL in patients with PDN. All studies were of a moderate quality, and results should be interpreted with caution. Conclusions Based on increasing knowledge in the domain of chronic pain, it could be assumed that integrated rehabilitation treatments for patients with PDN are beneficial. There is no literature to support this and more research should be done on integrated biopsychosocial interventions in patients with PDN. Implications This empty review highlights the importance that more research should be done on integrated biopsychosocial interventions in patients with PDN.

As full-fat dairy products are rich in saturated fat, these dietary guidelines recommend consumption of fat-free or low-fat dairy products in place of full-fat dairy. However, dairy products vary greatly in both their nutrient content and their bioactive ingredients, and research increasingly highlights the importance of focusing on whole foods (i.e., the food matrix) as opposed to single nutrients, such as saturated fat. In fact, the weight of evidence from recent large and well-controlled studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses of both observational studies and randomized controlled trials indicates that full-fat dairy products, particularly yogurt and cheese, do not exert the detrimental effects on insulin sensitivity, blood lipid profile, and blood pressure as previously predicted on the basis of their sodium and saturated fat contents; they do not increase cardiometabolic disease risk and may in fact protect against cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Although more research is warranted to adjust for possible confounding factors and to better understand the mechanisms of action of dairy products on health outcomes, it becomes increasingly clear that the recommendation to restrict dietary saturated fat to reduce risk of cardiometabolic disease is getting outdated. Therefore, the suggestion to restrict or eliminate full-fat dairy from the diet may not be the optimal strategy for reducing cardiometabolic disease risk and should be re-evaluated in light of recent evidence."}, "pico": {"P": "Adults with cardiometabolic disease risk factors", "I": "Consumption of full-fat dairy products", "C": "Consumption of fat-free or low-fat dairy products", "O": "Cardiometabolic disease risk factors such as insulin sensitivity, blood lipid profile, and blood pressure"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT01577030", "NCT02402985", "NCT01140165", "NCT01577030", "NCT01404897", "NCT01317251", "NCT01830946", "NCT01289639", "NCT00000611"]}

Several efforts have been made to reduce drug-induced nephrotoxicity; however, DIN remains a matter of concern. Statins with their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects may have the potential to protect kidney against DIN. The present review evaluated all of the available in vitro and in vivo studies that examined the use of statins as renoprotective agents against nephrotoxic drugs. Materials for this review were obtained by searching Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and Cochrane database of systematic reviews. Key words used as search terms included \"statin\", \"3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, \"HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors\", \"nephroprotective\", \"renoprotective\", \"drug-induced renal diseases\", \"drug-induced nephrotoxicity\", \"drug-induced renal toxicity\", \"drug-induced nephropathy\", \"drug-induced renal side effects\", and \"contrast-induced nephropathy\". This search was performed without time limitation. Only English language articles were included in this review. This review concluded that chronic statin user may be less prone to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) compared with statin non-users. Short-term high dose statin administration may also reduce the incidence of CIN in statin na\u00efve patients. This renoprotective effect of statins against CIN is seen in low risk patients with normal kidney function or mild kidney dysfunction, but probably not in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction.

We executed a PubMed literature search and included 49 articles that focused on complex congenital heart defects such as tetralogy of Fallot, systemic right ventricle, and univentricular hearts. Data on BNP measurements and cardiac function parameters were extracted. In all patients after correction for tetralogy of Fallot, BNP levels were elevated and correlated significantly with right ventricular end-diastolic dimensions and severity of pulmonary valve regurgitation. Patients with a systemic right ventricle had elevated BNP levels, and positive correlations between BNP and right ventricular function were seen. In patients with a univentricular heart, elevated BNP levels were observed before completion of the Fontan circulation or when patients were symptomatic; a clear association between BNP and New York Heart Association functional class was demonstrated. In conclusion, this review shows an overall increase in BNP values in complex CHD, although differences between types of congenital heart anomaly are present.

A systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis were, therefore, undertaken to evaluate the available evidence from randomized trials. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erlotinib versus doublets (erlotinib plus another targeted agent) in advanced NSCLC and, if adequate data are available, to investigate whether or not predefined patient groups benefit more or less from doublet-targeted therapy based on erlotinib. Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. Randomized controlled clinical trials were conducted in which any erlotinib was compared with doublets based on erlotinib in patients with NSCLC who had failed to respond to any previous chemotherapy regimen. Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion in the review and extracted data. A systematic review and meta-analysis based on aggregate data extracted from trial publications were carried out to assess the effectiveness of doublets (erlotinib plus another targeted drug) in NSCLC treatment. The efficacy outcomes were objective response rate (ORR), complete response plus partial response; disease control rate (DCR), complete response plus partial response and stable disease; and 1-year overall survival (OS). The adverse effects (AEs) were also considered. This involved identifying eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and extracting aggregate data from the reports of these RCTs. Hazard ratios were calculated from published summary statistics and then combined to give pooled estimates of treatment efficacy. This meta-analysis comprised five studies including 2,100 patients (mean age 63; 1,224 men and 876 women; 118 stage IIIB and 1,180 stage IV; 441 squamous cell cancers, 1,287 adenocarcinomas, and 372 other pathological types). Doublets regimen significantly improved ORR [hazard ratio (HR) 1.49, 1.13-1.98, p\u2009<\u20090.05] and DCR (HR 1.25, 1.12-1.39, p\u2009<\u20090.05) compared with single erlotinib, but 1-year OS was not significantly improved for doublets [HR 1.06; 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI), 0.95-1.18]. All-grade rash, anemia, diarrhea, anorexia, and fatigue were not significantly different between doublet and erlotinib groups (HR 1.25, 0.99-1.58; 0.98, 0.78-1.24; 1.43, 0.97-2.11; 1.18, 0.84-1.65; and 1.23, 0.86-1.77, respectively). The total grade of \u22653 AEs was also not significantly different (HR 1.40, 95\u00a0% CI 0.97-2.01). Compared with single-agent erlotinib, doublets (erlotinib plus another targeted agent) significantly improve ORR and DCR, but not OS, and induce no significance of more frequent and serious AEs. The benefit-to-risk ratio of doublets in advanced NSCLC may be more favorable than that of single-agent. The results of this systematic review suggest that patients with advanced NSCLC might benefit from doublet-targeted therapy based on erlotinib compared to erlotinib alone.

The extent of HIV-HBsAg co-infection is unknown. We undertook a systematic review to estimate the global burden of HBsAg co-infection in PLHIV. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and other databases for published studies (2002-2018) measuring prevalence of HBsAg among PLHIV. The review was registered with PROSPERO (#CRD42019123388).

Implementation strategies were shown to be effective with substantial heterogeneity of treatment effects across all investigated strategies. Primary aim of this study was to explain different effects of eligible trials and to identify methodological and clinical effect modifiers. Random effects meta-regression models were used to simultaneously assess the influence of multimodal implementation strategies and effect modifiers on physician adherence. Effect modifiers included the staff responsible for implementation, level of prevention and definition pf the primary outcome, unit of randomization, duration of follow-up and risk of bias. Six clinical and methodological factors were investigated as potential effect modifiers of the efficacy of different implementation strategies on guideline adherence in primary care practices on the basis of information from 75 eligible trials. Five effect modifiers were able to explain a substantial amount of statistical heterogeneity. Physician adherence was improved by 62% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 29 to 104%) or 29% (95% CI 5 to 60%) in trials where other non-medical professionals or nurses were included in the implementation process.

In the face of challenges such as HIV, Ebola, poverty, conflict and disaster the numbers have grown rather than reduced. Some countries have closed institutions down -driven by findings that cognitive developmental delay is associated with institutional care. Yet insight into abuse and violence within institutionalised settings is neglected. Maltreatment -violence and abuse -may be an issue. This systematic review series addresses violence and abuse experiences in institutionalised care, exploring firstly the frequency of abuse/violence in institutions, secondly any interventions to reduce such violence or abuse and thirdly the perpetrators of such violence or abuse. The final systematic review updates the findings on cognitive delay associated with institutionalised care. With a violence lens, cognitive delay may well be considered under the umbrella of neglect. Maltreatment and abuse may be a driver of cognitive delay. The keyword search covered several electronic databases and studies were included for data abstraction if they met adequacy criteria. Eight studies were identified on the prevalence of abuse in institutions and a further three studies reported on interventions. Only one study was identified documenting peer on peer violence in institutions. Sixty-six studies were identified examining cognitive development for institutionalised children. All but two of these record cognitive deficits associated with institutionalisation. Only two asked about violence or abuse which was found to be higher in institutionalised children. Overall the abuse experiences of children in institutions are poorly recorded, and in one study violence was associated with high suicidal attempts. The major intervention pathway for ameliorating cognitive challenge seems to be placement out of the institutions which shows benefits and redresses some cognitive outcomes - yet not a total panacea. The single study providing training and monitoring of harsh punishment and maltreatment showed immediate and decided reductions. This data suggest, despite the paucity of studies, violence and abuse, by commission or omission is prevalent in institutions, has an effect on child well-being and is amenable to intervention.

Several studies have shown how pharmacists have been contributing to reduce morbidity and mortality related to drug-therapy (MMRDT). However, there still is a lack of reviews that assemble evidence-based clinical pharmacists' counseling. Equally, there is also a need to understand structure characteristics, processes and technical contents of these clinical services. Aim of the review To review the structure, processes and technical contents of pharmacist counseling or education reported in randomized controlled trials (RCT) that had positive health-related outcomes. Methods We performed a systematic search in specialized databases to identify RCT published between 1990 and 2013 that have evaluated pharmacists' counseling or educational interventions to patients. Methodological quality of the trials was assessed using the Jadad scale. Pharmacists' interventions with positive clinical outcomes (p < 0.05) were evaluated according to patients' characteristics, setting and timing of intervention, reported written and verbal counseling. Results 753 studies were found and 101 RCT matched inclusion criteria. Most of the included RCTs showed a Jadad score between two (37 studies) and three (32 studies). Pharmacists were more likely to provide counseling at ambulatories (60 %) and hospital discharge (25 %); on the other hand pharmacists intervention were less likely to happen when dispensing a medication. Teaching back and explanations about the drug therapy purposes and precautions related to its use were often reported in RCT, whereas few studies used reminder charts, diaries, group or electronic counseling. Most of studies reported the provision of a printed material (letter, leaflet or medication record card), regarding accessible contents and cultural-concerned informations about drug therapy and disease. Conclusion Pharmacist counseling is an intervention directed to patients' health-related needs that improve inter-professional and inter-institutional communication, by collaborating to integrate health services. In spite of reducing MMRDT, we found that pharmacists' counseling reported in RCT should be better explored and described in details, hence collaborating to improve medication-counseling practice among other countries and settings."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients receiving pharmacist counseling in randomized controlled trials", "I": "Pharmacist-led patient counseling or education", "C": "Standard care or usual practice", "O": "Positive health-related outcomes"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00238836", "NCT00374270", "NCT00201045", "NCT00323258"]}

Studies investigating consequences of hypokalemia after acute myocardial infarction revealed conflicting results. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to combine evidence from previous studies on the association of serum potassium concentration with both short and long-term mortality as well as the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods A structured search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases yielded 23 articles published between 1990 and January 2017 that met the inclusion criteria. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were carried out by three reviewers. Random effects models were used to pool estimates across the included studies and sensitivity analyses were performed when possible. Results Twelve studies were included in the meta-analysis. Both pooled results from six studies investigating short-term mortality and from five studies examining long-term mortality revealed significantly increased risks in patients with serum potassium concentrations of <3.5\u2009mEq/L, 4.5-<5.0\u2009mEq/L and \u22655.0\u2009mEq/L after acute myocardial infarction. In addition, a serum potassium concentration of <3.5\u2009mEq/L was significantly associated with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. Conclusions Mortality, both short and long term, and the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with acute myocardial infarction seem to be negatively associated with hypokalemic serum potassium concentration.

PA subtypes include aerobic, resistance, flexibility, neuromotor (involving balance, agility and co-ordination), mind-body (e.g. tai chi, qi gong and yoga) and mixed type trainings. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that PA subtypes can have positive clinical effects, however the effects on the symptomatology may vary according to the PA subtype. It therefore stands to reason that various PA subtypes may modulate the immune system and neuroplastic processes differently. This systematic review aims to assess the immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles of various PA subtypes, particularly in unipolar depression and age-related cognitive decline (ARCD). The literature suggests several unique immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles for PA subtypes (i.e. resistance, aerobic and mind-body) in depression and ARCD. In depression, levels of various cytokines at baseline may predict treatment response to subtypes of PA and pharmacological agents. The pro-neuroplastic effects of resistance and aerobic PA in ARCD may differ due to variances in neurotrophin profiles. At this stage of literature in the field, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the specific immunomodulatory and neuroplastic pathways involved in these PA subtypes given of the small number of comparative studies and methodological heterogeneity between studies (e.g. study population age and illness severity, as well as duration and intensity of PA intervention).

Results indicated that women with symptoms of PPA are less likely to breastfeed exclusively and more likely to terminate breastfeeding earlier. Some evidence also suggests that those experiencing PPA are less likely to initiate breastfeeding and more likely to supplement with formula in the hospital. In those who do breastfeed, PPA reduces self-efficacy, increases breastfeeding difficulties, and may negatively affect breastfeeding behaviors and breast milk composition. Heterogeneous outcomes and methodological limitations somewhat limit the comparability of findings.

However, a large amount of variation exists in its efficacy. Sex of participants and exercise type are two possible factors contributing to this variation. To better understand this, we conducted a concurrent systematic review and meta-analysis of cognitively healthy older adults. Executive functions, episodic memory, visuospatial function, word fluency, processing speed and global cognitive function were examined for exercise- and sex-dependent effects. For executive functions, three types of exercise interventions - aerobic training, resistance training, and multimodal training (i.e., both aerobic and resistance training) - were associated with larger effect sizes in studies comprised of a higher percentage of women compared to studies with a lower percentage of women. This suggests that women's executive processes may benefit more from exercise than men. Regardless of sex, compared to control, all three exercise training approaches enhanced visuospatial function, but only multimodal training enhanced episodic memory. Overall, aerobic training led to greater benefits than resistance training in global cognitive function and executive functions, while multimodal combined training led to greater benefits than aerobic training for global cognitive function, episodic memory, and word fluency.

Depression is an independent risk factor for mortality in cardiovascular samples. Neuroendocrine dysfunctions in MDD are related to an overactive hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and increased sympathetic activity. Novel intervention strategies for MDD include the non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In fact, although these techniques have being increasingly used as a treatment for MDD, their cardiovascular effects were not sufficiently investigated, which would be important considering the dyad MDD/cardiovascular disorders. We investigated this issue through a systematic review for published articles from the first date available to May 2012 in MEDLINE and other databases, looking for main risk factors and surrogate markers for cardiovascular disease such as: cortisol, heart rate variability (HRV), alcohol, smoking, obesity, hypertension, glucose. We identified 37 articles (981 subjects) according to our eligibility criteria. Our main findings were that NIBS techniques might be effective strategies for down-regulating HPA activity and regulating food, alcohol, and cigarette consumption. NIBS's effects on HRV and blood pressure presented mixed findings, with studies suggesting that HRV values can decrease or remain unchanged after NIBS, while one study found that rTMS increased blood pressure levels. Also, a single study showed that glucose levels decrease after tDCS. However, most studies tested the acute effects after one single session of rTMS/tDCS; therefore further studies are necessary to investigate whether NIBS modifies cardiovascular risk factors in the long-term. In fact, considering the burden of cardiac disease, further trials in cardiovascular, depressed, and non-depressed samples using NIBS should be performed."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and cardiovascular risk factors", "I": "Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)", "C": "No comparison group specified in the systematic review", "O": "Effects of NIBS on cardiovascular risk factors such as cortisol, heart rate variability (HRV), alcohol, smoking, obesity, hypertension, and glucose levels"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00901459"]}

Many proposals aiming to eliminate its occurrence include the empowerment of women through their socio-economic development. In this context, some studies suggested that microcredit programs (MP) and cash transfer programs (CTP) are initiatives that can also reduce the risk of IPV. Others pointed to an opposite effect. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of women's economic empowerment in MP and CTP on the risk of physical, psychological and sexual violence through a systematic review. Papers/documents selection was conducted by two researchers according to the following criteria: published in English, Portuguese or Spanish; primary data; assessing the effect of MP or CTP on IPV; in heterosexual couples; on women beneficiaries of the intervention; using a comparator group eligible for an MP or CTP; and focusing on risk IPV as the outcomes. Our results showed that the impact of MP are mixed when it comes to physical and physical/sexual violence. Even so, the review suggests that the effect of MP on sexual violence is trivial or nonexistent. Regarding the impact of CTPs, the present study showed that the effects on physical, physical/sexual, psychological, and sexual violence were also heterogeneous. Women more empowered and with some autonomy could be at risk. Despite that, participation in the empowerment program should be encouraged for poor women and families.

In China, irrational uses of blood have often been reported in recent years. However, to date there lacks a systematic review of the rational uses of blood. This study aimed to determine the clinical appropriateness of blood transfusion in China. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database, WanFang Database, and Chinese BioMedical Literature Database, and the retrieval cut-off date was June 31, 2015. SPSS 17.0 and MetaAnalyst 3.13 were employed as the statistics tools in this review. A pooled rate of clinical inappropriateness of transfusion was analyzed by DerSimonian-Laird method. In this study, a total of 39 observational studies were included, which related to 75,132 cases of blood transfusion. According to the meta-analysis results, the overall incidence of clinical inappropriateness of transfusion in China was estimated to be 37.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] [32.1, 42.8]). The subgroup analyses revealed that the pooled rates of clinical inappropriateness of transfusion of plasma, red blood cells (RBCs), cryoprecipitate, and platelets were 56.3% (95% CI [45.8, 66.2]), 30.9% (95% CI [27.1, 35.0]), 25.2% (95% CI [13.2, 42.7]), and 14.1% (95% CI [8.8, 21.9]), respectively. However, the pooled incidence of inappropriateness of transfusion in operative departments was 47.5% (95% CI [36.8, 58.3]), which was significantly higher than that in nonoperative departments, 25.8% (95% CI [18.7, 34.4], P\u200a<\u200a0.05).

Reports on the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on glucose metabolism in people with T2DM and OSA are conflicting. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to examine the effect of CPAP treatment on glucose metabolism by synthesizing findings from randomized controlled trials. The PRISMA review protocol was developed and registered in PROSPERO. A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Cochrane was conducted from inception to March 2017. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the study quality. Review Manager (v5.2) was used for the meta-analyses, and the standardized mean difference was calculated. Six studies consisting of 496 participants were included in this review. The meta-analyses indicated that CPAP treatment did not have significant impact on glucose metabolism measured by A1C (mean difference\u00a0=\u00a00.05, 95% CI -\u00a00.14 to 0.24, P\u00a0=\u00a00.61), fasting insulin level (mean difference\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a02.34, 95% CI -\u00a08.19 to 3.51, P\u00a0=\u00a00.43), and fasting glucose (mean difference\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a00.05, 95% CI -\u00a00.52 to 0.42, P\u00a0=\u00a00.84).

Here, we comprehensively review all published systematic reviews (through October 2016) on adolescents (10-19 years) and women of reproductive age, including pregnant women, which targeted interventions related to nutrition. For interventions where there was no existing systematic review on adolescents, we reviewed primary studies/trials. We included interventions on micronutrient supplementation (iron, folic acid, iron-folic acid (IFA), calcium, vitamin D, vitamin A, zinc, iodine, and multiple micronutrients), food/protein energy supplementation, nutrition education for pregnant adolescents, obesity prevention and management, and management of gestational diabetes. We identified a total of 35 systematic reviews, of which only five were conducted on adolescents, and 107 primary studies on adolescents. Our review suggests that iron alone, IFA, zinc, and multiple micronutrient supplementation in adolescents can significantly improve serum hemoglobin concentration. While zinc supplementation in pregnant adolescents showed improvements in preterm birth and low birth weight, we found a paucity of trials on calcium, vitamin D, vitamin A, and iodine supplementation. We found limited evidence on food/protein energy supplementation in adolescents. Interventions to prevent and manage obesity showed a nonsignificant impact on reducing body mass index.

This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of lifestyle modification control trials that utilize exercise interventions, with or without dietary intervention, on weight loss among postpartum women. A search of randomized clinical trials (RCT) was performed using the follow databases and the bibliography of candidate studies: MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, CENTRAL/Cochrane and Physiotherapy Evidence Database. English language RCT papers published up to 31 October 2012, which present changes on maternal body weight from baseline to the end of exercise intervention were included. The primary meta-analysis examined the effects of exercise interventions, with or without complementary dietary intervention, on weight loss during the postpartum period compared with usual standard of care. Five subgroup analyses were performed to examine differences in study interventions and exercise modalities: duration of intervention, quality of study methodology, supervision of exercise intervention, exercise intervention goals used and the type of dietary intervention. In total 11 studies met eligibility criteria with 769 participants, 409 under intervention and 360 in the control group. The primary meta-analysis included all 11 studies and found a mean difference (MD) on weight loss of -2.57\u2009kg (95% CI -3.66 to -1.47). The subgroup analysis demonstrated that the most effective interventions in reducing weight in postpartum women were exercise programs with objectively defined goals, such as the use of heart rate monitors or pedometer (MD of -4.09\u2009kg-95% CI -4.94 to -3.25, I(2)=0%) and exercise combined with intensive dietary intervention (MD of -4.34\u2009kg-95% CI -5.15 to -3.52, I(2)=0%).

The aim of the current study was to systematically retrieve, qualitatively and quantitatively pool, as well as critically appraise all available evidence on 9vHPV from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We conducted a systematic review of the literature on 9vHPV efficacy, immunogenicity and safety, as well as a systematic search of registered, completed, and ongoing RCTs. We retrieved and screened 227 records for eligibility. A total of 10 publications reported on RCTs' results on 9vHPV and were included in the review. Sixteen RCTs on 9vHPV have been registered on RCT registries. There is evidence that 9vHPV generated a response to HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 that was non-inferior to qHPV. Vaccine efficacy against five additional HPV type-related diseases was directly assessed on females aged 16-26 years (risk reduction against high-grade cervical, vulvar or vaginal disease = 96\u00b77%, 95% CI 80\u00b79%-99\u00b78%). Bridging efficacy was demonstrated for males and females aged 9-15 years and males aged 16-26 years (the lower bound of the 95% CIs of both the geometric mean titer ratio and difference in seroconversion rates meeting the criteria for non-inferiority for all HPV types). Overall, 9vHPV has been proved to be safe and well tolerated. Other RCTs addressed: 9vHPV co-administration with other vaccines, 9vHPV administration in subjects that previously received qHPV and 9vHPV efficacy in regimens containing fewer than three doses. The inclusion of additional HPV types in 9vHPV offers great potential to expand protection against HPV infection.

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the impact of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 'real-world' interventions on the cognitive abilities of healthy older adults. Database searches were performed between October 2016 and September 2018. Forty-three RCTs were eligible for inclusion with 2826 intervention participants and 2234 controls. Interventions to enhance cognitive ability consisted of participation in activities that were physical (25 studies), cognitive (9 studies), or mixed (i.e., physical and cognitive; 7 studies), and two studies used other interventions that included older adults assisting schoolchildren and engagement via social network sites. Meta-analysis revealed that Trail Making Test (TMT) A, p\u2009=\u2009 0.05, M\u2009=\u20090.43, 95% CI [-0.00, 0.86], digit symbol substitution, p\u2009=\u2009 0.05, M\u2009=\u20090.30, 95% CI [0.00, 0.59], and verbal fluency, p\u2009=\u2009 0.04, M\u2009=\u20090.31, 95% CI [0.02, 0.61], improved after specific types of interventions versus the control groups (which were either active, wait-list or passive controls).

These meta-analyses have often adopted different analyses and study selection criteria. Because it is difficult to have a clear picture of vaccine benefits and harms examining single systematic reviews, we compiled the main findings and evaluated which could be the most reasonable explanations for some differences in findings (or their interpretation) across previously published meta-analyses. For each age group, we performed analyses that included all trials that had been included in at least one relevant meta-analysis, also exploring whether effect sizes changed over time. Although we identified several discrepancies among the meta-analyses on seasonal vaccines for children and elderly, overall most seasonal influenza vaccines showed statistically significant efficacy/effectiveness, which was acceptable or high for laboratory-confirmed cases and of modest magnitude for clinically-confirmed cases. The available evidence on parenteral inactivated vaccines for children aged < 2 y remains scarce.

The utility of platinum agents, in addition to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), is controversial. To assess the activity of platinum agents in patients with TNBC treated with NAC, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published studies. A search of PubMed, EMBASE, the Web of Science, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed to identify studies that investigated platinum-based NAC in patients with TNBC. Random effect models were adopted to estimate the summary risk ratio (RR), and the publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot and Egger's regression asymmetry test.

Overall, the pooled rate of pCR in patients treated with platinum-based NAC was 45 %.

Exercise has been proposed as a strategy to help address the issues faced by cancer patients. Supported by a growing body of research, major health organizations commonly identify the importance of incorporating exercise in cancer care and advise patients to be physically active. This systematic review comprehensively summarizes the available epidemiologic and randomized controlled trial evidence investigating the role of exercise in the management of cancer. Literature searches focused on determining the potential impact of exercise on 1) cancer mortality and recurrence and 2) adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. A total of 100 studies were reviewed involving thousands of individual patients whose exercise behavior was assessed following the diagnosis of any type of cancer. Compared with patients who performed no/less exercise, patients who exercised following a diagnosis of cancer were observed to have a lower relative risk of cancer mortality and recurrence and experienced fewer/less severe adverse effects.

In addition the reference lists of all identified articles were examined to identify studies that were not captured by electronic searches. We performed a metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials of asymptomatic singleton gestations with previous PTB who were assigned randomly to prophylactic omega-3 supplementation vs control (either placebo or no treatment). The primary outcome was predefined as PTB at <37 weeks of gestation. The pooled results were reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The protocol of this review was registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42015016371). Two randomized controlled trials that included 1080 women were analyzed. The mean gestational age at randomization was approximately 134 days in both groups (mean difference, 0.01 days; 95% CI, -0.13 to 0.14). Women who received omega-3 had similar rates of PTB at <37 weeks of gestation (34.5% vs 39.8%; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59-1.12) and PTB at <34 weeks of gestation (12.0% vs 15.4%; RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.26-1.46) compared with control subjects.

There was a statistically significant benefit for n-3 in CD (relative risk [RR] 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.98); however, the studies were heterogeneous (I(2) = 58%). The absolute risk reduction was -0.14 (95% CI: -0.25 to -0.02). Opinions may vary on whether this is a clinically significant effect. Two well-done studies with a larger sample size reported no benefit. A sensitivity analysis excluding a small pediatric study resulted in the pooled RR being no longer statistically significant. A funnel plot analysis suggested publication bias for the smaller studies. For UC, there was no difference in the relapse rate between the n-3 and control groups (RR 1.02; 95% CI: 0.51-2.03). The pooled analysis showed a higher rate of diarrhea (RR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.01-1.84) and symptoms of the upper gastrointestinal tract (RR 1.96; 95% CI: 1.37-2.80) in the n-3 treatment group.

The technique was developed more than 60 years ago, but not much used for many decades. Technical improvements, easy protocols and higher sensitivity compared with standard lung function tests in some disease groups have led to a recent renaissance of MBW. The lung clearance index (LCI) is a common measure derived from MBW tests, and offers information on lung pathology complementary to that from conventional lung function tests such as spirometry. The LCI measures the overall degree of pulmonary ventilation inhomogeneity. There are other MBW-derived parameters, which describe more regional airway ventilation and enable specific information on conductive or acinar ventilation inhomogeneity. How this specific ventilation distribution is exactly related to different disease processes has not entirely been examined yet. MBW measurements are performed during tidal breathing, making this technique attractive for children, even young children and infants. These benefits and the additional physiological information on ventilation inhomogeneity early in the course of lung diseases have led to increasing research activities and clinical application of MBW, especially in paediatric lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF). In these patients, LCI detects early airway damage and enables monitoring of disease progression and treatment response. Guidelines for the standardisation of the MBW technique were recently published. These guidelines will, hopefully, increase comparability of LCI data obtained in different centres or intervention trials in children and adults. In this non-systematic review article, we provide an overview of recent developments in MBW, with a special focus on children. We first explain the physiological and technical background to this technique with a short explanation of several methodological aspects that are important for understanding the principle behind the technique and enable high quality measurements. We then provide examples of MBW application in different lung diseases of children and adults, with regards to both clinical application and research activities. Lastly, we report on ongoing clinical trials using MBW as outcome and give an outlook on possible future developments."}, "pico": {"P": "Children and adults with lung diseases, especially cystic fibrosis (CF)", "I": "Multiple breath inert gas washout (MBW) technique", "C": "Standard lung function tests such as spirometry", "O": "Detection of early airway damage, monitoring of disease progression and treatment response, increased comparability of LCI data obtained in different centres or intervention trials, additional physiological information on ventilation inhomogeneity"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT01897233", "NCT02270476", "NCT00557089", "NCT00635141", "NCT01262352", "NCT00709280"]}

Maternal breastfeeding intention and ongoing breastfeeding duration are strongly predicted by their partners' breastfeeding beliefs. Partner support has a significant effect on improving rates of any and exclusive breastfeeding, when compared with professional support, particularly in low-income populations. This systematic review investigates the effectiveness of breastfeeding interventions targeting fathers in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). A systematic literature search was undertaken on Medline (EBSCOhost), PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Scopus databases and via manual searching. Inclusion criteria were experimental or quasiexperimental designs targeting fathers from LMIC, which measured either breastfeeding initiation, breastfeeding exclusivity, or duration of breastfeeding as the main outcomes. No time restriction was put in place, and all articles were published in English. The quality of selected papers was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool. A total of 8 articles were included from 6 interventions: 2 quasiexperimental and 4 randomized control trials. All interventions involved breastfeeding education targeting fathers; 2 were given only to fathers, and 4 delivered to both fathers and mothers. Among these interventions, 2 measured both early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding; one exclusive breastfeeding only; one exclusive breastfeeding, knowledge, and attitudes; one exclusive breastfeeding and knowledge; and one breastfeeding, continued breastfeeding, and awareness. Across all interventions, breastfeeding education showed significant improvement in breastfeeding outcomes in the intervention compared with the control groups. In summary, breastfeeding education interventions targeting fathers in LMIC are effective in improving early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding, and continued breastfeeding. Thus, breastfeeding promotion should consider the education and involvement of fathers in the intervention."}, "pico": {"P": "Fathers in low- and middle-income countries", "I": "Breastfeeding interventions targeting fathers", "C": "Standard care or no intervention", "O": "Improvement in early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding, and continued breastfeeding"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT01352351"]}

According to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), wild poliovirus is still in circulation in three countries, and fresh cases have been reported even in the year 2018. Due to the administration of live vaccines, the risk for vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is high in areas that are free from wild polioviruses. This is evident based on the fact that VDPV caused 20 outbreaks between 2000 and 2011. Recent recommendations from the World Health Organization favoured the inclusion of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in the global immunisation schedule. IPV can be delivered in two ways: intramuscularly and intradermally. IPV was previously administered intramuscularly, but shortages in vaccine supplies, coupled with the higher costs of the vaccines, led to the innovation of delivering a fractional dose (one-fifth) of IPV intradermally.

Many studies have considered the quality of life in people with breast cancer because this condition has high comorbidity with mental distress, anxiety, affective disorders and depression. Psychological interventions can reduce the stressful consequences of both the diagnosis and the medical treatments of breast cancer. However, different methods (e.g., group or individual therapy) and focus (e.g., improving personal skills or increasing emotional well-being) do not help to identify which type of psychological therapy can be more effective in improving quality of life in patients with breast cancer. This study was aimed to systematically review and compare, by means of a meta-analysis, the efficacy of cognitive behavioural, supportive-expressive or psycho-educational treatments in women with breast cancer, focusing on anxiety, depression, mood and quality of life as outcomes. The PRISMA statement was adopted. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PUBMED and PsycArticles databases were used, and reference lists were examined for additional publications. In the selection of the articles were included studies considering women between 18 and 65 years who were diagnosed with breast cancer at any stage and under any treatment, and who underwent psychological group interventions. At the end of the systematic review, 45 studies met all inclusion criteria and were analysed in the meta-analysis. The overall effect size was medium, especially considering cognitive behavioural therapy and psycho-educational treatments. However, the studies are characterised by high methodological heterogeneity.

The systematic search yielded a total number of 50 randomized vaccine clinical trials investigating 12 different vaccines, most commonly rotavirus and malaria vaccines. In these trials, 94,459 AEFI were reported from 446,908 participants receiving 735,920 vaccine doses. All 50 RCTs mentioned safety outcomes with 70% using definitions for at least one AEFI. The most commonly defined AEFI was fever (27), followed by local (16) and systemic reactions (14). Logistic regression analysis revealed a positive correlation between the implementation of a fever case definition and the reporting rate for fever as an AEFI (p=0.027). Overall, 16 different definitions for fever and 7 different definitions for erythema were applied. Predefined AEFI case definitions by the Brighton Collaboration were used in only two out of 50 RCTs.

Fish oils that contain higher amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) than docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), in a distinctive ratio of 18/12, are typically the most abundantly available and are commonly studied. Although the two fatty acids have traditionally been considered together, as though they were one entity, different physiological effects of EPA and DHA have recently been reported. New oils containing a higher quantity of DHA compared with EPA, such as fractionated and concentrated fish oil, tuna oil, calamari oil and microalgae oil, are increasingly becoming available on the market, and other oils, including those extracted from genetically modified oilseed crops, soon to come. This systematic review focuses on the effects of high DHA fish oils on various human health conditions, such as the heart and cardiovascular system, the brain and visual function, inflammation and immune function and growth/Body Mass Index. Although inconclusive results were reported in several instances, and inconsistent outcomes observed in others, current data provides substantiated evidence in support of DHA being a beneficial bioactive compound for heart, cardiovascular and brain function, with different, and at times complementary, effects compared with EPA. DHA has also been reported to be effective in slowing the rate of cognitive decline, while its possible effects on depression disorders are still unclear.

It was supposed to enhance bone formation and reduce bone resorption simultaneously.

Because it is the prerequisite for measuring the combined efficacy of PRF plus 1%ALN, firstly we evaluated the effectiveness of 1%ALN. Our data indicated that adjunctive 1%ALN was effective in promoting periodontal bone repair.

For molecular pathways, local cryotherapy induces an intrajoint temperature decrease, which might downregulate several mediators involved in joint inflammation and destruction (cytokines, cartilage-degrading enzymes, proangiogenic factors), but studies in RA are rare. Cryotherapy should be included in RA therapeutic strategies as an adjunct therapy, with potential corticosteroid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug dose-sparing effects. However, techniques and protocols should be more precisely defined in randomized controlled trials with stronger methodology."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases, specifically rheumatoid arthritis", "I": "Cryotherapy (local or whole-body)", "C": "Standard care without cryotherapy", "O": "Decrease in pain visual analog scale and 28-joint disease activity score, potential corticosteroid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug dose-sparing effects"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00159835"]}

The MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published until March 2018, evaluating histomorphometric outcomes after MSA. Predictor variables were autogenous bone (AB), allografts (AG), xenografts (XG), alloplastic bone (AP), AB+XG, AB+AP, AG+XG, XG+AP, and grafts combined with autologous platelet concentrates/recombinant growth factors, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), or recombinant bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Outcome variables were NBF%, RG%, and CT%. Healing time was considered. The weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated via frequentist network meta-analysis using Stata software. Fifty-two RCTs (1483 biopsies) were included. At a healing time <6 months, AB was superior to AP (WMD-10.66%, 95% CI-16.38% to -4.94%) and XG (WMD-7.93%, 95% CI-15.11% to -0.75%) for NBF. Regarding CT, AB was superior to XG+AP, AP, MSCs, and XG. At a healing time \u22656 months, NBF was higher for AB than AP (WMD-7.06%, 95% CI-12.59% to -1.52%).

First, is diabetes nutrition therapy effective? Clinical trials as well as systematic and Cochrane reviews report a ~1%-2% lowering of hemoglobin A1c values as well as other beneficial outcomes from nutrition therapy interventions, depending on the type and duration of diabetes and level of glycemic control. Clinical trials also provide evidence for the effectiveness of nutrition therapy in the prevention of diabetes. Second, are weight loss interventions important and when are they beneficial? Modest weight loss is important for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and early in the disease process. However, as diabetes progresses, weight loss may or may not result in beneficial glycemic and cardiovascular outcomes. Third, are there ideal percentages of macronutrients and eating patterns that apply to all persons with diabetes? There is no ideal percentage of macronutrients and a variety of eating patterns has been shown to be effective for persons with diabetes. Treatment goals, personal preferences (eg, tradition, culture, religion, health beliefs, economics), and the individual's ability and willingness to make lifestyle changes must all be considered by clinicians and/or educators when counseling and educating individuals with diabetes. A healthy eating pattern emphasizing nutrient-dense foods in appropriate portion sizes, regular physical activity, and support are priorities for all individuals with diabetes. Reduced energy intake for persons with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes as well as matching insulin to planned carbohydrate intake are intervention to be considered. Fourth, is the question of how to implement nutrition therapy interventions in clinical practice.

Clinically relevant, short- and long-term efficacy outcomes, such as those related to a reduced risk of disease, as well as outcomes related to safety, were sought. MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library literature searches performed in September 2010 were limited to randomized controlled trials, their systematic reviews or meta-analyses. LCPUFA supplementation, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), of infant formula for preterm infants has consistently demonstrated better visual development of preterm infants compared with unsupplemented formulas. There is increasing evidence to suggest that LCPUFA supplementation for preterm infants is also related to improvements in more global measures of development, without any adverse effects. It is, however, important to note that the DHA doses tested in the infant formula interventions for preterm infants have been rather conservative. Newer studies comparing dietary DHA concentrations that match in utero accumulation rates with dietary DHA concentrations typical in the milk of women consuming little fish or in supplemented infant formulas demonstrate that these higher DHA doses are related to improvements in domains of cognitive development. Although further work is needed to better understand the optimal DHA requirements of preterm infants, it is clear that a dietary source of DHA is important to support neurodevelopment. To date, the most promising application of probiotics in preterm infants is the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis by the administration of certain probiotics. Many other benefits of administering probiotics and/or prebiotics to preterm infants are, however, largely unproven. Efficacy and safety should be established for each probiotic and/or prebiotic product. Further research should specify strain-specific outcomes and determine optimal dosing schedules.

Inclusion criteria\u2002 Types of participants\u2002 Adult caregivers who provide support for people with dementia living in the community (non-institutional care). Types of interventions\u2002 Interventions designed to support caregivers in their role such as skills training, education to assist in caring for a person living with dementia and support groups/programs. Interventions of formal approaches to care designed to support caregivers in their role, care planning, case management and specially designated members of the healthcare team - for example dementia nurse specialist or volunteers trained in caring for someone with dementia. Types of studies\u2002 This review considered any meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomised control trials, quasi-experimental studies, cohort studies, case control studies and observational studies without control groups that addressed the effectiveness of interventions that assist caregivers to provide support for people living with dementia in the community. Search strategy\u2002 The search sought to identify published studies from 2000 to 2005 through the use of electronic databases. Only studies in English were considered for inclusion. The initial search was conducted of the databases, CINAHL, MEDLINE and PsychINFO using search strategies adapted from the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group. A second more extensive search was then conducted using the appropriate Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords for other available databases. Finally, hand searching of reference lists of articles retrieved and of core dementia, geriatric and psycho geriatric journals was undertaken. Assessment of quality\u2002 Methodological quality of each of the articles was assessed by two independent reviewers using appraisal checklist developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute and based on the work of the Cochrane Collaboration and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Data collection and analysis\u2002 Standardised mean differences or weighted mean differences and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each included study reported in the meta-analysis. Results from comparable groups of studies were pooled in statistical meta-analysis using Review Manager Software from the Cochrane Collaboration. Heterogeneity between combined studies was tested using standard chi-square test. Where statistical pooling was not appropriate or possible, the findings are summarised in narrative form. Results\u2002 A comprehensive search of relevant databases, hand searching and cross referencing found 685 articles that were assessed for relevance to the review. Eighty-five papers appeared to meet the inclusion criteria based on title and abstract, and the full paper was retrieved. Of the 85 full papers reviewed, 40 were accepted for inclusion, three were systematic reviews, three were meta-analysis, and the remaining 34 were randomised controlled trials. For the randomised controlled trials that were able to be included in a meta-analysis, standardised mean differences or weighted mean differences and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each. Results from comparable groups of studies were pooled in statistical meta-analysis using Review Manager Software and heterogeneity between combined studies was assessed by using the chi-square test. Where statistical pooling was not appropriate or possible, the findings are summarised in narrative form. The results are discussed in two main sections. Firstly it was possible to assess the effectiveness of different types of caregiver interventions on the outcome categories of depression, health, subjective well-being, self-efficacy and burden. Secondly, results are reported by main outcome category. For each of these sections, meta-analysis was conducted where it was possible; otherwise, a narrative summary describes the findings. Effectiveness of intervention type\u2002 Four categories of intervention were included in the review - psycho-educational, support, multi-component and other. Psycho-educational Thirteen studies used psycho-educational interventions, and all but one showed positive results across a range of outcomes. Eight studies were entered in a meta-analysis. No significant impact of psycho-educational interventions was found for the outcome categories of subjective well-being, self-efficacy or health. However, small but significant results were found for the categories of depression and burden. Support Seven studies discussed support only interventions and two of these showed significant results. These two studies were suitable for meta-analysis and demonstrated a small but significant improvement on caregiver burden. Multi-component Twelve of the studies report multi-component interventions and 10 of these report significant outcomes across a broad range of outcome measures including self-efficacy, depression, subjective well-being and burden. Unfortunately because of the heterogeneity of study designs and outcome measures, no meta-analysis was possible. Other interventions Other interventions included the use of exercise or nutrition which resulted in improvements in psychological distress and health benefits. Case management and a computer aided support intervention provided mixed results. One cognitive behavioural therapy study reported a reduction in anxiety and positive impacts on patient behaviour. Effectiveness of interventions using specific outcome categories\u2002 In addition to analysis by type of intervention it was possible to analyse results based on some outcome categories that were used across the studies. In particular the impact of interventions on caregiver depression was available for meta-analysis from eight studies. This indicated that multi-component and psycho-educational interventions showed a small but significant positive effect on caregiver depression. Five studies using the outcome category of caregiver burden were entered into a meta-analysis and findings indicated that there were no significant effects of any of interventions. No meta-analysis was possible for the outcome categories of health, self-efficacy or subjective well-being. Implications for practice\u2002 From this review there is evidence to support the use of well-designed psycho-educational or multi-component interventions for caregivers of people with dementia who live in the community. Factors that appear to positively contribute to effective interventions are those which: \u2022\u2002 Provide opportunities within the intervention for the person with dementia as well as the caregiver to be involved \u2022\u2002 Encourage active participation in educational interventions for caregivers \u2022\u2002 Offer individualised programs rather than group sessions \u2022\u2002 Provide information on an ongoing basis, with specific information about services and coaching regarding their new role \u2022\u2002 Target the care recipient particularly by reduction in behaviours Factors which do not appear to have benefit in interventions are those which: \u2022\u2002 Simply refer caregivers to support groups \u2022\u2002 Only provide self help materials \u2022\u2002 Only offer peer support."}, "pico": {"P": "Adult caregivers providing support for people with dementia living in the community", "I": "Interventions designed to support caregivers such as skills training, education, support groups/programs, care planning, case management, dementia nurse specialist or volunteers trained in caring for someone with dementia", "C": "Standard care or other types of caregiver support interventions", "O": "Effectiveness of interventions on outcomes such as depression, health, subjective well-being, self-efficacy, and burden"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00177489"]}

Five studies involving 3476 patients and two anti-IL-13 antibodies (lebrikizumab and tralokinumab) were included in this meta-analysis. Compared to the placebo, anti-IL-13 treatments were associated with significant improvement in asthma exacerbation, FEV1 and AQLQ scores, and reduction in rescue medication use. Adverse events and serious adverse events were similar between two groups. Subgroup analysis showed patients with high periostin level had a lower risk of asthma exacerbation after receiving anti-IL-13 treatment. Our study suggests that anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibodies could improve the management of uncontrolled asthma. Periostin may be a good biomarker to detect the specific subgroup who could get better response to anti-IL-13 treatments. In view of blocking IL-13 alone is possibly not enough to achieve asthma control because of the overlapping pathophysiological roles of IL-13/IL-4 in inflammatory pathways, combined blocking of IL-13 and IL-4 with monoclonal antibodies may be more encouraging."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with uncontrolled asthma", "I": "Anti-interleukin-13 monoclonal antibodies (lebrikizumab and tralokinumab)", "C": "Placebo", "O": "Improvement in asthma exacerbation rate, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) scores, reduction in rescue medication use, adverse events"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00930163", "NCT01867125", "NCT01402986"]}

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate evidence related to the use of acupuncture for HFs in cancer patients. EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane (all databases), PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Scopus were searched from their inception through December 2014. Included studies had to be randomized controlled trials with a usual-care and/or placebo comparison group that investigated acupuncture to treat HFs in cancer patients. No language limits were applied. The risk of bias (ROB) was rated as low, high, or unclear according to Cochrane criteria. Both within-group and between-group changes were evaluated. Four hundred two items were identified, and 192 duplicates were omitted; this left 210 publications to be screened. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, and all involved women with breast cancer. All studies showed significant within-group improvement from the baseline for true acupuncture (TA). One study showed significant improvement in favor of TA over sham acupuncture (SA; P < .001), 1 study found in favor of TA over SA for nighttime HFs only (P = .03), and 1 study found in favor of TA over SA or untreated controls (P < .01 and P < .001, respectively). Between-group (TA vs SA) effect size (ES) estimates for daytime and nighttime HFs were calculated (ES range, 0.04-0.9) whenever possible. No studies were rated with a low ROB. In conclusion, the current level of evidence is insufficient to either support or refute the benefits of acupuncture for the management of HFs in cancer patients.

We focused on randomised controlled trials, controlled studies and reviews published between October 2008 and August 2015, since the earlier review. The search of PsychInfo, Medline and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews yielded 61 relevant articles, organised into four themes echoing key phases of the care pathway: Living at home with dementia (five reviews, eight studies), carer interventions (three reviews, four studies), interventions in residential care (16 reviews, 12 studies) and end-of-life care (three reviews, two studies), along with an additional group spanning community and institutional settings (six reviews, two studies). Community findings suggested that appointment of dementia specialists and attention to case management can produce positive outcomes; physical therapies, cognitive training and modified cognitive behaviour therapy also had a range of benefits. There was more limited evidence of positive benefits for people with dementia through interventions with family carers. Thirty-two articles focused on the management of 'behavioural symptoms' through a range of interventions all of which had some evidence of benefit. Also a range of multi-component and specific interventions had benefits for cognitive, emotional and behavioural well-being of people with dementia in residential settings, as well as for quality of life. Overall, interventions tended to be short term with impact only measured in the short term.

This report reviews the etiology and pathophysiology of depression, and explores the role of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) as a possible treatment. In seeking to understand depression, genetic factors and environmental influences have been extensively investigated. Research has led to several hypotheses for the pathophysiological basis of depression but a definitive pathogenic mechanism, or group thereof, has hitherto remained equivocal. To date, treatment has been based on the monoamine hypothesis and hence, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been the most widely used class of medication. In the last decade, there has been considerable interest in n-3 PUFAs and their role in depression. These fatty acids are critical for development and function of the central nervous system. Increasing evidence from epidemiological, laboratory, and randomized placebo-controlled trials suggests deficiency of dietary n-3 PUFAs may contribute to development of mood disorders, and supplementation with n-3 PUFAs may provide a new treatment option. Conclusions based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses of published trials to date vary. Research into the effects of n-3 PUFAs on depressed mood is limited. Furthermore, results from such have led to conflicting conclusions regarding the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs in affecting reduction in symptoms of depression. PUFAs are generally well tolerated by adults and children although mild gastrointestinal effects are reported. There is mounting evidence to suggest that n-3 PUFAs play a role in depression and deserve greater research efforts."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with depression", "I": "Omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation", "C": "Placebo or standard care (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors)", "O": "Reduction in symptoms of depression and improvement in mood"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00331305"]}

The MEDLINE, CINAHL, psycINFO, psycARTICLES, Academic Search Premier, Alt HealthWatch, Health Source: Consumer Edition, and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition databases were searched for peer-reviewed research publications between 1991 and October 2012. A total of nine articles were retained for review. The quality of the studies and the interventions varied significantly, which precluded making definitive conclusions but findings among a majority of retained studies suggest that telephone-based MI may help improve medication adherence. The included studies provided promising results and justification for continued exploration in the provision of MI via telephone encounters. Future research is needed to address gaps in the current literature but the results suggest that MI may be an efficient option for healthcare professionals seeking an evidence-based method to reach remote or inaccessible patients to help them improve their medication adherence."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with chronic diseases struggling with medication adherence", "I": "Telephone-based motivational interviewing for medication adherence", "C": "Traditional in-person counseling or standard care", "O": "Improved medication adherence and health behavior change"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00567294"]}

The diagnosis is not rarely delayed, and the majority of patients present with loco-regionally advanced disease. The rate of second primary tumors after a diagnosis of HNC is about 3-7% per year, the highest rate among solid tumors. Currently, a single-modality or a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy (CHT), is the standard treatment for stage III-IV HNC. For the recurrent/metastatic setting, in the last 40\u00a0years great efforts have been made in order to develop a more effective CHT regimen, from the use of methotrexate alone, to the combination of cisplatin (CDDP) and 5-fluorouracile (5FU) or paclitaxel. Recently, the introduction of cetuximab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, to the CDDP-5FU doublet (EXTREME regimen) has improved the overall response rate, the progression-free survival and the overall survival (OS) compared to CHT alone. Nowadays, the EXTREME regimen is the standard of care for the first-line treatment of recurrent/metastatic head and neck carcinoma (RMHNC). In the last years, new promising therapies for RMHNC such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which have demonstrated favorable results in second-line clinical trials, gained special interest. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are the first two ICIs able to prolong OS in the second-, later-line and platinum-refractory setting, with tolerable toxicities.

Current research reports mixed findings concerning the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions delivered by teachers for mental health outcomes. This article presents a systematic review and meta-analysis that examined the effectiveness of school-based psychosocial interventions delivered by teachers on internalizing and externalizing outcomes and the moderating factors that influence treatment effects on these outcomes. Nine electronic databases, major journals, and gray literature (e.g., websites, conference abstract) were searched and field experts were contacted to locate additional studies. Twenty-four studies that met the study inclusion criteria were coded into internalizing or externalizing outcomes and further analyzed using robust variance estimation in meta-regression. Both publication and risk of bias of studies were further assessed. The results showed statistically significant reductions in students' internalizing outcomes (d\u00a0=\u00a0.133, 95% CI [.002, .263]) and no statistical significant effect for externalizing outcomes (d\u00a0=\u00a0.15, 95% CI [-.037, .066]).

We have performed a systematic review of all randomized controlled trials in which HPV vaccines were compared with placebo regarding safety, tolerability and adverse effects. Studies were searched up to March 2013 in the databases: Pubmed, Embase, Scielo and Cancerlit. Odds Ratios (OR) of most incident adverse effects were obtained. Twelve reports, involving 29,540 subjects, were included.

We performed a systematic search of the studies using LF-rTMS over the contralesional hemisphere in stroke patients and reviewed the 67 identified articles. The studies have been gathered together according to the time interval that had elapsed between the stroke onset and the beginning of the rTMS treatment. Inhibitory rTMS of the contralesional hemisphere can induce beneficial effects on stroke patients with motor impairment, spasticity, aphasia, hemispatial neglect and dysphagia, but the therapeutic clinical significance is unclear. We observed considerable heterogeneity across studies in the stimulation protocols. The use of different patient populations, regardless of lesion site and stroke aetiology, different stimulation parameters and outcome measures means that the studies are not readily comparable, and estimating real effectiveness or reproducibility is very difficult. It seems that careful experimental design is needed and it should consider patient selection aspects, rTMS parameters and clinical assessment tools. Consecutive sessions of rTMS, as well as the combination with conventional rehabilitation therapy, may increase the magnitude and duration of the beneficial effects. In an increasing number of studies, the patients have been enrolled early after stroke. The prolonged follow-up in these patients suggests that the effects of contralesional LF-rTMS can be long-lasting. However, physiological evidence indicating increased synaptic plasticity, and thus, a more favourable outcome, in the early enrolled patients, is still lacking. Carefully designed clinical trials designed are required to address this question.

Subgroup analyses investigated the impact on the estimated effects of the following parameters: methodological quality; portion of the assessed upper limb; duration of stroke; and intervention dose and duration. Thirty-eight studies involving 1174 participants were included. Pooled estimates revealed small effects of RT on motor control and medium effects on strength compared with other intervention (OI) at a short-term follow-up. Standardized differences in means were as follows: 0.3 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.4) and 0.5 (95% CI 0.2 to 0.8).

With the prevalence approaching 85% in obese populations, new therapeutic approaches to manage NAFLD are warranted. A systematic search of the literature was conducted for studies pertaining to the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation on NAFLD in humans. Primary outcome measures were liver fat and liver function tests: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase [1]. Data were pooled and meta-analyses conducted using a random effects model. Nine eligible studies, involving 355 individuals given either omega-3 PUFA or control treatment were included.

Several studies have shown that telerehabilitation is effective to improve clinical outcomes in disabling conditions. The aim of this review was to determine whether telerehabilitation was more effective than other modes of delivering rehabilitation to regain motor function, in different populations of patients.We searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library retrieving 2360 records. Twelve studies were included involving different populations (i.e. neurological, total knee arthroplasty (TKA), cardiac) of patients. Inconclusive finding were found on the effect of telerehabilitation for neurological patients (SMD\u2009=\u20090.08, CI 95%\u2009=\u2009-0.13, 0.29), while both for cardiac (SMD\u2009=\u20090.24, CI 95%\u2009=\u20090.04, 0.43) and TKA patients (Timed Up and Go test: MD\u2009=\u2009-5.17, CI 95%\u2009=\u2009-9.79, -0.55) the results were in favour of telerehabilitation.Conclusive evidence on the efficacy of telerehabilitation for treatment of motor function, regardless of pathology, was not reached.

Meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model with DerSimonian and Laird estimator for the amount of heterogeneity to estimate the pooled outcomes. A funnel plot and Egger's regression test were used to test publication bias. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used to assess the quality of the studies. There were 6 studies (3 prospective, 3 retrospective) that met the criteria for meta-analysis with a total of 3231 patients, 567 were in the minimally invasive group and 2664 in the laparotomy group. Both groups were similar in stage and serous histology. Complete cytoreductive surgery was achieved in 74.50% (95% CI 40.41-97.65%) and 53.10% (95% CI 4.88-97.75%) of patients in the minimally invasive and laparotomy groups, respectively. There was no statistical significant difference between these 2 pooled proportions (p\u2009=\u20090.52). Three studies compared minimally invasive surgery vs laparotomy. No significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in obtaining complete cytoreductive surgery [OR\u2009=\u20090.90 (95% CI 0.70-1.16; p\u2009=\u20090.43)]. A symmetrical funnel plot indicated no publication bias. The pooled proportion for grade\u2009>\u20092 postoperative complications was not significant among the laparoscopy group [3.11% (95% CI 0.00-10.24%; p\u2009=\u20090.15)]. Complete cytoreductive surgery appears feasible and safe with minimally invasive surgery in selected advanced ovarian cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with stage IIIC-IV ovarian cancer who have undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy", "I": "Minimally invasive interval cytoreductive surgery", "C": "Laparotomy surgery", "O": "Achievement of complete cytoreductive surgery and postoperative complications"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00262847", "NCT02324595", "NCT00003636"]}

Although multiple pharmacotherapeutics are in development, currently there are limited strategies specifically targeting NAFLD. This systematic review summarizes the existing literature on hepatic effects of medications used for weight loss. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists are the best-studied in this regard, and evidence consistently demonstrates reduction in liver fat content, sometimes accompanied by improvements in histological features of steatohepatitis and reductions in serum markers of hepatic injury such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT). It remains unclear whether these benefits are independent of the weight loss caused by these agents. Literature is limited regarding effects of orlistat, but a small number of reports suggest that orlistat reduces liver fat content and improves histologic features of NASH, benefits which may also be driven primarily by weight loss. A sizeable body of literature on hepatic effects of metformin yields mixed results, with a probability of modest benefit, but no consistent signal for strong benefit. There are insufficient data on hepatic effects of topiramate, phentermine, naltrexone, bupropion, and lorcaserin. Finally, a few studies to date suggest that sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may reduce liver fat content and cause modest reductions in ALT, but further study is needed to better characterize these effects.

There are considerable differences in cost between countries, driven in part by differences in the use of biologic therapies. Economic evaluations are needed to assess the extra cost of using these treatments and the benefits obtained, to ensure appropriate allocation of limited health care resources. The BeSt trial, evaluating four treatment strategies, found comparable medium-term efficacy but substantially higher costs with early biologic therapy. A systematic review of such cost-effectiveness analyses concluded that biologic therapy should be used after therapy has failed with less costly alternatives such as synthetic DMARDs and glucocorticoids. Optimizing such relatively low-cost therapy to improve outcomes may delay the need for biologic therapy, thereby saving costs. A simple model has confirmed the value of this approach. The addition of modified-release prednisone 5 mg/day to existing synthetic DMARD therapy in patients with active disease resulted in improvement in DAS-28 to below the threshold level for initiation of reimbursed biologic therapy in 28-34% of patients. On a conservative estimate (i.e. assuming no further benefits beyond the 12 weeks of the study and a 12-week wait-and-see approach to starting biologic therapy), cost savings amounted to nearly \u20ac 400 per patient.

Women with PCOS had increased prevalence of overweight [RR (95% CI): 1.95 (1.52, 2.50)], obesity [2.77 (1.88, 4.10)] and central obesity [1.73 (1.31, 2.30)] compared with women without PCOS. The Caucasian women with PCOS had a greater increase in obesity prevalence than the Asian women with PCOS compared with women without PCOS [10.79 (5.36, 21.70) versus 2.31 (1.33, 4.00), P < 0.001 between subgroups). CONCLUSIONS Women with PCOS had a greater risk of overweight, obesity and central obesity. Although our findings support a positive association between obesity and PCOS, our conclusions are limited by the significant heterogeneity between studies and further studies are now required to determine the source of this heterogeneity. Clinical management of PCOS should include the prevention and management of overweight and obesity."}, "pico": {"P": "Women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)", "I": "Prevalence of overweight, obesity, and central obesity", "C": "Comparison between women with PCOS and women without PCOS", "O": "Increased risk of overweight, obesity, and central obesity in women with PCOS"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00203996", "NCT00428311"]}

The aim of the current review was to provide updated evidence about the efficacy and tolerability of anticonvulsants in the treatment of acute bipolar depression. A comprehensive review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of anticonvulsants for the treatment of acute bipolar depression up to June 2011 was conducted by means of the PubMed-Medline database. Eligibility criteria included active comparator-controlled or placebo-controlled randomized studies involving monotherapy or combination therapy. A total of 18 RCTs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Studies supported the efficacy of divalproex as monotherapy in acute bipolar depression but small sample size was a common methodological limitation. Findings were inconclusive for lamotrigine and carbamazepine although overall lamotrigine may have a beneficial but modest effect. Negative results were found for levetiracetam and gabapentin but the evidence base on these agents is scant. All anticonvulsants were generally well tolerated. No double-blind RCTs were found for the use of other anticonvulsants such as oxcarbazepine, licarbazepine, zonisamide, retigabine, pregabalin, tiagabine, felbamate and vigabatrine in the acute treatment of bipolar depression. To sum up, taking into consideration the efficacy and tolerability profiles of anticonvulsants, current evidence supports the use of divalproex and lamotrigine in the treatment of acute bipolar depression.

Maximal total point motion (MTPM) at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years were considered. Results - The literature search yielded 1,167 hits of which 53 studies were included, comprising 111 study groups and 2,470 knees. The majority of the early migration occurred in the first 6 months postoperatively followed by a period of stability, i.e., no or very little migration. Cemented and uncemented tibial components had different migration patterns. For cemented tibial components there was no difference in migration between all-poly and metal-backed components, between mobile bearing and fixed bearing, between cruciate retaining and posterior stabilized. Furthermore, no difference existed between TKR measured with model-based RSA or marker-based RSA methods. For uncemented TKR there was some variation in migration with the highest migration for uncoated TKR. Interpretation - The results from this meta-analysis on RSA migration of TKR are in line with both the survival analyses results from joint registries of these TKRs as well as revision rates results from meta-analyses, thus providing further proof for the association between early migration and late revision for loosening. The pooled migration patterns can be used both as benchmarks and for defining migration thresholds for future evaluation of new TKR."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients who have undergone total knee replacement (TKR)", "I": "RSA migration analysis of tibial components of TKR", "C": "Comparison between cemented and uncemented tibial components of TKR", "O": "Outcome measures include maximal total point motion (MTPM) at various postoperative time points and the association between early migration and late revision for loosening"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00436982", "NCT01604382"]}

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCT) since 2003 investigating the impact of genetic risk communication on health behaviour to prevent cardiometabolic disease, without restrictions on age, duration of intervention or language. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses for perceived motivation for behaviour change and clinical changes (weight loss) and a narrative analysis for other outcomes.

This is an updated version of a Cochrane review first published in 2005. OBJECTIVES: To assess effects of long-term HT (at least 1 year's duration) on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, fracture and cognition in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women during and after cessation of treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases to September 2016: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO. We searched the registers of ongoing trials and reference lists provided in previous studies and systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised double-blinded studies of HT versus placebo, taken for at least 1 year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. HT included oestrogens, with or without progestogens, via the oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or intranasal route. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of the evidence by using GRADE methods. MAIN RESULTS: We included 22 studies involving 43,637 women. We derived nearly 70% of the data from two well-conducted studies (HERS 1998; WHI 1998). Most participants were postmenopausal American women with at least some degree of comorbidity, and mean participant age in most studies was over 60 years. None of the studies focused on perimenopausal women.In relatively healthy postmenopausal women (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease), combined continuous HT increased the risk of a coronary event (after 1 year's use: from 2 per 1000 to between 3 and 7 per 1000), venous thromboembolism (after 1 year's use: from 2 per 1000 to between 4 and 11 per 1000), stroke (after 3 years' use: from 6 per 1000 to between 6 and 12 per 1000), breast cancer (after 5.6 years' use: from 19 per 1000 to between 20 and 30 per 1000), gallbladder disease (after 5.6 years' use: from 27 per 1000 to between 38 and 60 per 1000) and death from lung cancer (after 5.6 years' use plus 2.4 years' additional follow-up: from 5 per 1000 to between 6 and 13 per 1000).Oestrogen-only HT increased the risk of venous thromboembolism (after 1 to 2 years' use: from 2 per 1000 to 2 to 10 per 1000; after 7 years' use: from 16 per 1000 to 16 to 28 per 1000), stroke (after 7 years' use: from 24 per 1000 to between 25 and 40 per 1000) and gallbladder disease (after 7 years' use: from 27 per 1000 to between 38 and 60 per 1000) but reduced the risk of breast cancer (after 7 years' use: from 25 per 1000 to between 15 and 25 per 1000) and clinical fracture (after 7 years' use: from 141 per 1000 to between 92 and 113 per 1000) and did not increase the risk of coronary events at any follow-up time.Women over 65 years of age who were relatively healthy and taking continuous combined HT showed an increase in the incidence of dementia (after 4 years' use: from 9 per 1000 to 11 to 30 per 1000). Among women with cardiovascular disease, use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism (at 1 year's use: from 3 per 1000 to between 3 and 29 per 1000). Women taking HT had a significantly decreased incidence of fracture with long-term use.Risk of fracture was the only outcome for which strong evidence showed clinical benefit derived from HT (after 5.6 years' use of combined HT: from 111 per 1000 to between 79 and 96 per 1000; after 7.1 years' use of oestrogen-only HT: from 141 per 1000 to between 92 and 113 per 1000). Researchers found no strong evidence that HT has a clinically meaningful impact on the incidence of colorectal cancer.One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy women 50 to 59 years of age who were taking combined continuous HT and 1637 who were taking oestrogen-only HT versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT: Their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1/500. However, other differences in risk cannot be excluded, as this study was not designed to have the power to detect differences between groups of women within 10 years of menopause.For most studies, risk of bias was low in most domains. The overall quality of evidence for the main comparisons was moderate. The main limitation in the quality of evidence was that only about 30% of women were 50 to 59 years old at baseline, which is the age at which women are most likely to consider HT for vasomotor symptoms. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Women with intolerable menopausal symptoms may wish to weigh the benefits of symptom relief against the small absolute risk of harm arising from short-term use of low-dose HT, provided they do not have specific contraindications. HT may be unsuitable for some women, including those at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, increased risk of thromboembolic disease (such as those with obesity or a history of venous thrombosis) or increased risk of some types of cancer (such as breast cancer, in women with a uterus). The risk of endometrial cancer among women with a uterus taking oestrogen-only HT is well documented.HT is not indicated for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia, nor for prevention of deterioration of cognitive function in postmenopausal women. Although HT is considered effective for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, it is generally recommended as an option only for women at significant risk for whom non-oestrogen therapies are unsuitable. Data are insufficient for assessment of the risk of long-term HT use in perimenopausal women and in postmenopausal women younger than 50 years of age."}, "pico": {"P": "Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women", "I": "Long-term hormone therapy (at least 1 year's duration)", "C": "Placebo", "O": "Mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, fracture, cognition"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00000611", "NCT00000611", "NCT00000611", "NCT00000611", "NCT00114517", "NCT00392093", "NCT00154180", "NCT00000611", "NCT00252408", "NCT00000611", "NCT01124773", "NCT00000611", "NCT00000611", "NCT00114517", "NCT00000611", "NCT00000559", "NCT00000611", "NCT00000611"]}

Its prevalence increases with age and preferentially affects male patients. Over 75 years of age, however, female patients being more prevalent, the absolute number of patients affected is similar between sexes. Despite this, few data are available in the literature concerning sex-related differences in atrial fibrillation patients. The present systematic review therefore considers comorbidities, referring symptoms, quality of life, pharmacological approaches and trans-catheter ablation in female rather than in male atrial fibrillation patients in search of parameters that may have an impact on the treatment outcome. In brief, female atrial fibrillation patients more commonly present comorbidities, leading to a higher prevalence of persistent atrial fibrillation; moreover, they refer to hospital care later and with a longer disease history. Atrial fibrillation symptoms relate to low quality of life in female patients; in fact, atrial fibrillation paroxysm usually presents higher heart rate, leading to preferentially adopt a rate rather than a rhythm-control strategy. Female atrial fibrillation patients present an increased risk of stroke, worsened by the lower oral anticoagulant prescription rate related to the concomitant higher haemorrhagic risk profile. Trans-catheter ablation is under-used in female patients and, on the contrary, they are more commonly affected by anti-arrhythmic drug side effects."}, "pico": {"P": "Female patients with atrial fibrillation", "I": "Pharmacological approaches and trans-catheter ablation", "C": "Male patients with atrial fibrillation", "O": "Impact on treatment outcome, comorbidities, referring symptoms, quality of life, prevalence of persistent atrial fibrillation, risk of stroke, oral anticoagulant prescription rate, side effects of anti-arrhythmic drugs"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00262600", "NCT00412984"]}

The correct differentiation between a true erosion and other entities-then often called \"pseudoerosions\"-is essential to avoid misdiagnosing rheumatoid arthritis and to correctly interpret the progress of the disease. The aims of this systematic review were as follows: to create a definition and delineation of the term \"pseudoerosion\", to point out morphological pitfalls in the interpretation of images, and to report on difficulties arising from choosing different imaging modalities. A systematic review on bone erosions in rheumatoid arthritis was performed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The following search terms were applied in PubMed and Scopus: \"rheumatoid arthritis\", \"bone erosion\", \"ultrasonography\", \"radiography\", \"computed tomography\" and \"magnetic resonance imaging\". Appropriate exclusion criteria were defined. The systematic review registration number is 138826. The search resulted ultimately in a final number of 25 papers.

It can be classified according to their configuration, shape, content, and can be described specifically with an anatomical term. \"Calcified zone\" is a term to describe the deep components of the subchondral, subligamentous and subtendinous bone, and may be applied for all non-cancellous borders of a bone, thus representing a third type of the bone matrix beside the cortical and the trabecular bone."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with rheumatoid arthritis", "I": "Differentiation between true erosions and pseudoerosions", "C": "N/A", "O": "Creation of a definition and delineation of pseudoerosions, identification of morphological pitfalls in imaging interpretation, and reporting on difficulties with different imaging modalities"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00209859"]}
