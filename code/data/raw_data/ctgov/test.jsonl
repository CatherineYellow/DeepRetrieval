Previous systematic reviews examining intervention effects on dual-task gait and mobility have not assessed relative dual-task costs (DTC) or investigated whether there are differences in treatment-related changes based on the type of dual task or the type of control group. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the effects of physical exercise interventions on dual-task performance during walking in older adults. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared treatment effects between physical exercise intervention and control groups on single- and dual-task gait speed and relative DTC on gait speed. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO searched up to September 19, 2014. Randomized, nonrandomized, and uncontrolled studies published in English and involving older adults were selected. Studies had to include a physical exercise intervention protocol and measure gait parameters during continuous, unobstructed walking in single- and dual-task conditions before and after the intervention. Of 614 abstracts, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. Fourteen RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The mean difference between the intervention and control groups significantly favored the intervention for single-task gait speed (mean difference: 0.06 m/s, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.10, p < 0.001), dual-task gait speed (mean difference: 0.11 m/s, 95% CI 0.07, 0.15, p < 0.001), and DTC on gait speed (mean difference: 5.23%, 95% CI 1.40, 9.05, p = 0.007). Evidence from subgroup comparisons showed no difference in treatment-related changes between cognitive-motor and motor-motor dual tasks, or when interventions were compared to active or inactive controls. In summary, physical exercise interventions can improve dual-task walking in older adults primarily by increasing the speed at which individuals walk in dual-task conditions. Currently, evidence concerning whether physical exercise interventions reduce DTC or alter the self-selected dual-task strategy during unobstructed walking is greatly lacking, mainly due to the failure of studies to measure and report reciprocal dual-task effects on the non-gait task."}, "pico": {"P": "Older adults with dual-task interference during walking", "I": "Physical exercise interventions", "C": "Control group (no intervention or alternative intervention)", "O": "Improvement in single- and dual-task gait speed, reduction in relative dual-task costs on gait speed"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT01107288", "NCT01381237"]}

Its vigilance promoting properties and low abuse potential has intrigued the scientific community and has led to use it as a cognitive enhancer, before its neural functions were understood. Here, we review the effects of modafinil in human cognition and emotion and its specific actions on symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and whether these are consistently effective throughout the literature. We also performed a systematic review on the effects of modafinil on neurotransmitter signalling in different areas of the brain in order to better understand the neuromechanisms of its cognitive and emotional enhancing properties. A review of its effects in schizophrenia suggests that modafinil facilitates cognitive functions, with pro-mnemonic effects and problem solving improvements. Emotional processing also appears to be enhanced by the drug, although to date there are only a limited number of studies. The systematic review on the neurochemical modulation of the modafinil suggests that its mnemonic enhancing properties might be the result of glutamatergic and dopaminergic increased neuronal activation in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex respectively. Other neurotransmitters were also activated by modafinil in various limbic brain areas, suggesting that the drug acts on these brain regions to influence emotional responses. These reviews seek to delineate the neuronal mechanisms by which modafinil affects cognitive and emotional function.

This reduction was significant (P < 0.001) in T2DM subjects, specifically (n = 1426, mean baseline HbA1c = 7.44%, 58\u00a0mmol/mol), with HbA1c% lowered by -0.21 \u00b1 0.04 units (-2.29 \u00b1 0.4\u00a0mmol/mol). Polyphenol supplementation had no significant effect (P > 0.21) in the non-diabetic (n = 258, mean baseline HbA1c = 5.47%, 36\u00a0mmol/mol) and the pre-diabetic subjects (n = 270, mean baseline HbA1c = 6.06%, 43\u00a0mmol/mol) strata: -0.39 \u00b1 0.27 HbA1c% units (-4.3 \u00b1 0.3\u00a0mmol/mol), and -0.38 \u00b1 0.31 units (-4.2 \u00b1 0.31\u00a0mmol/mol), respectively.

Methods An update panel conducted a targeted systematic literature review by searching PubMed and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, clinical practice guidelines, and observational studies. Results Thirty-five relevant studies were identified, and updated evidence supports the current recommendations. Recommendations For patients with active symptomatic multiple myeloma that requires systemic therapy with or without evidence of lytic destruction of bone or compression fracture of the spine from osteopenia on plain radiograph(s) or other imaging studies, intravenous administration of pamidronate 90 mg over at least 2 hours or zoledronic acid 4 mg over at least 15 minutes every 3 to 4 weeks is recommended. Denosumab has shown to be noninferior to zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events and provides an alternative. Fewer adverse events related to renal toxicity have been noted with denosumab compared with zoledronic acid and may be preferred in this setting. The update panel recommends that clinicians consider reducing the initial pamidronate dose in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Zoledronic acid has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment and is not recommended in this setting. The update panel suggests that bone-modifying treatment continue for up to 2 years. Less frequent dosing has been evaluated and should be considered in patients with responsive or stable disease. Continuous use is at the discretion of the treating physician and the risk of ongoing skeletal morbidity. Retreatment should be initiated at the time of disease relapse.

Within the field of health promotion, CTs constitute a healthy public policy initiative as they have the potential to address the social determinants of health (SDoH) and health inequalities. A systematic review was conducted to synthesise the evidence on CTs' impacts on SDoH and health inequalities in sub-Saharan Africa, and to identify the barriers and facilitators of effective CTs. Twenty-one electronic databases and the websites of 14 key organizations were searched in addition to grey literature and hand searching of selected journals for quantitative and qualitative studies on CTs' impacts on SDoH and health outcomes. Out of 182 full texts screened for eligibility, 79 reports that reported findings from 53 studies were included in the final review. The studies were undertaken within 24 CTs comprising 11 unconditional CTs (UCTs), 8 conditional CTs (CCTs) and 5 combined UCTs and CCTs. The review found that CTs can be effective in tackling structural determinants of health such as financial poverty, education, household resilience, child labour, social capital and social cohesion, civic participation, and birth registration. The review further found that CTs modify intermediate determinants such as nutrition, dietary diversity, child deprivation, sexual risk behaviours, teen pregnancy and early marriage. In conjunction with their influence on SDoH, there is moderate evidence from the review that CTs impact on health and quality of life outcomes. The review also found many factors relating to intervention design features, macro-economic stability, household dynamics and community acceptance of programs that could influence the effectiveness of CTs. The external validity of the review findings is strong as the findings are largely consistent with those from Latin America. The findings thus provide useful insights to policy makers and managers and can be used to optimise CTs to reduce health inequalities."}, "pico": {"P": "Population: Individuals in sub-Saharan Africa", "I": "Intervention: Cash transfers (CTs)", "C": "Comparison: No specific comparison group mentioned in the abstract", "O": "Outcomes: Impact of CTs on social determinants of health (SDoH) and health outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT01333826", "NCT01838005", "NCT01233531"]}

Positive effects of a nutraceutical combination comprising red yeast rice, berberine, policosanol, astaxanthin, coenzyme Q10 and folic acid (NComb) on plasma lipid and glucose levels have been reported in some but not all clinical trials. To address this inconsistency, we tried to estimate the size of lipid- and glucose-lowering effects of NComb through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. A systematic literature search in PubMed-Medline, SCOPUS and Google Scholar databases was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of NComb on plasma lipids and glucose levels. Inverse variance-weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for net changes in lipid and glucose levels using a random-effects model. Random-effects meta-regression was performed to assess the effect of putative confounders on plasma lipid and glucose levels. Fourteen trials (1670 subjects in the NComb arm and 1489 subjects in the control arm) met the eligibility criteria for lipid analysis and 10 trials (1014 subjects in the NComb arm and 962 subjects in the control arm) for glucose analysis. Overall, WMDs were significant for the impact of NComb supplementation on plasma levels of total cholesterol (-26.15mg/dL, p<0.001), LDL-cholesterol (-23.85mg/dL, p<0.001), HDL-cholesterol (2.53mg/dL, p<0.001), triglycerides (-13.83mg/dL, p<0.001) and glucose (-2.59mg/dL, p=0.010). NComb-induced amelioration of lipid profile was not affected by duration of supplementation nor by baseline lipid levels; conversely, a greater glucose-lowering effect of NComb was found with higher baseline glucose levels and longer durations of supplementation. In conclusion, the present results suggest that NComb supplementation is associated with improvement of lipid and glucose profile.

We identified psychological or behavioral interventions that had been manualized and evaluated in either (a) experimental or quasi-experimental group studies or (b) systematic reviews of single-subject studies. We extracted data from all studies that met these criteria and were published after the previous review. Interventions were categorized across two dimensions. First, primary theoretical principles included applied behavior analysis (ABA), developmental social-pragmatic (DSP), or both. Second, practice elements included scope (comprehensive or focused), modality (individual intervention with the child, parent training, or classrooms), and intervention targets (e.g., spoken language or alternative and augmentative communication). We classified two interventions as well-established (individual, comprehensive ABA and teacher-implemented, focused ABA\u00a0+\u00a0DSP), 3 as probably efficacious (individual, focused ABA for augmentative and alternative communication; individual, focused ABA\u00a0+\u00a0DSP; and focused DSP parent training), and 5 as possibly efficacious (individual, comprehensive ABA\u00a0+\u00a0DSP; comprehensive ABA classrooms; focused ABA for spoken communication; focused ABA parent training; and teacher-implemented, focused DSP).

Depression frequently causes unemployment, absenteeism, and presenteeism, which results in significantly reduced productivity. Indirect costs of depression accounted for more than $50 billion, whereas direct costs resulted in expenditure of $26 billion, in the US in 2000. Improving patients' compliance with their antidepressant medication results in improved outcomes and prolongs remission from depression, increasing work productivity, and thus reducing overall costs. The implementation of remote enhanced-care programs may improve compliance and reduce overall costs. Novel methods for delivering enhanced-care programs to assist in maintaining compliance have the potential to further reduce costs and should be a focus of future research.

As the use of ETN has increased, associated adverse effects have been reported frequently. Previous meta-analyses have focused on comparing the differences in clinical outcomes between ETN and placebo (PBO). The present meta-analysis evaluated randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the effects of ETN and a PBO or sulfasalazine (SSZ) in patients with AS. The study population characteristics and the main results, including the Assessment in AS 20% response (ASAS 20), the Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and the Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI), were extracted. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) or weighted mean differences (MDs) were calculated using a fixed or random effects model. Fifteen randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2,194 subjects were included. Compared with a PBO, ETN significantly improved the ASAS 20 [P<0.00001; OR, 8.25; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.92-11.50], BASDAI (P<0.00001; MD, -18.81; 95% CI, -24.47 to -13.15) and BASFI (P<0.00001; standard MD, -0.68; 95% CI, -0.85 to -0.50).

It was based on the hypothesis that weight loss, particularly fat loss, would increase serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) in the obese. We conducted a systematic review of the literature over the last 21 years and included human trials that reported changes in 25OHD, weight, or body composition after weight loss. Study arms were excluded if vitamin D was supplemented, dietary intake exceeded 800 IU/d, or extreme sun exposure was reported. Eighteen of 23 trials that met our criteria documented an increase in vitamin D status with weight loss. Metaregression analyses indicated a marginally significant effect of weight loss on unadjusted weighted mean difference of 25OHD (\u03b2 = -0.60 [95% confidence interval {CI}, -1.24 to +0.04] nmol/L; P = .06) and after adjustment for study quality (Jadad score \u22653) (\u03b2 = -0.64 [95% CI, -1.28 to +0.01] nmol/L; P = .05). The effect of percent fat mass on weighted mean difference of 25OHD was also marginally significant before (\u03b2 = -0.91 [95% CI, -1.96 to +0.15] nmol/L; P = .08) and after adjustment of study quality (\u03b2 = -1.05 [95% CI, -2.18 to +0.08] nmol/L; P = .06). Collectively, these outcomes support a volumetric dilution of vitamin D. The slopes of the respective regression lines, however, indicate a smaller increase in 25OHD than would be expected from a direct mobilization of stores into the circulation. Hence, sequestration of 25OHD and its conversion to inactive metabolites would also play a role.

Both SRI and specific SRIs were examined and comparisons of SRI, placebo, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), combined (COMBO) treatments (SRI+CBT) made to investigate their relative efficacy. Using the Cochrane methodology, and as measures of effect size mean difference and Hedge's g, SRIs proved to be superior to drug placebo, with a modest effect size. From direct comparisons of CBT and SRI treatments, we conclude that CBT has the superior efficacy. COMBO versus CBT shows that SRI treatment adds little to concomitant CBT, while COMBO shows favourable outcome versus SRI alone. In pre-trial partial treatment responders, those who failed a SRI had better outcome from adding CBT as compared to continuing a SRI.

Pooled estimates for change in hemoglobin levels at four weeks favored daily oral lactoferrin over daily oral ferrous sulphate (mean difference 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-1.55; P=0.04, 4 trials, 600 women). However, after subgroup analysis (degree of anemia), no significant difference in hemoglobin levels were found between both groups in mild anemia (mean difference 0.80; 95% CI -0.21 to 1.82, 3 trials, 372 women), but a significant increase favoring lactoferrin was reported in moderate anemia (mean difference 0.68; 95% CI 0.53-0.83; P<0.00001, one trial, 228 women). Significantly less gastrointestinal side effects were reported with lactoferrin treatment. No significant differences existed with regard to other outcomes. In conclusion, for pregnant women with IDA, daily oral bovine lactoferrin is just as good as ferrous sulfate in improving hematological parameters with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Thereby, lactoferrin should be the iron replacement agent of choice for treatment of IDA in pregnancy."}, "pico": {"P": "Pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia", "I": "Daily oral bovine lactoferrin", "C": "Daily oral ferrous iron preparations", "O": "Change in hemoglobin levels, change in serum ferritin and iron levels, rates of gastrointestinal side effects, preterm birth, low birthweight, neonatal death, mean birthweight"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT01221844"]}

This evidence has fostered the hypothesis that increasing vitamin D intake may treat and prevent such disorders. Our objective was to perform a critical analysis of the highest-level evidence for ten common beliefs regarding vitamin D for the prevention of falls, fractures and respiratory tract infections, the reduction of cancer incidence/mortality and overall mortality, and the prevention or treatment of depression/mental well-being, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, as well as maximum dosing and regular testing. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and PubMed (up to August 2014) for randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews/meta-analyses based on those studies. All searches were performed, all evidence reviewed and each section written by at least two authors. The evidence shows that vitamin D supplementation provides some benefit in fracture prevention (likely \u223c10-15\u00a0% relative reduction), particularly at a dose \u2265800\u00a0IU and with calcium; a likely benefit in the rate of falls, though it is less clear whether the number of fallers changes; and a possible small (\u223c5\u00a0%) relative reduction in mortality. Evidence does not support the use of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of cancer, respiratory infections or rheumatoid arthritis. Similarly, evidence does not support vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis or for improving depression/mental well-being. Regular testing of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is generally not required, and mega-doses (\u2265300,000\u00a0IU) appear to increase harms. Much of the evidence is at high risk of bias, with multiple flaws, including analyses of secondary endpoints, small and underpowered studies, inconsistent results and numerous other issues.

A combined weighted linear model meta-regression analyses of natural log (Ln) total vitamin D intake (i.e. diet and supplemental vitamin D) v. achieved serum 25(OH)D in winter (that used by the North American Dietary Reference Intake Committee) produced a curvilinear relationship (mean (95 % lower CI) serum 25(OH)D (nmol/l) = 9\u00b72 (8\u00b75) Ln (total vitamin D)).

Successful generalisation is necessary for an intervention to have benefits in everyday life beyond the original learning environment. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of early social communication interventions for children with autism in order to explore generalisation and its measurement. We identified nine RCTs that provided evidence of initial target learning and measured generalisation, of which eight demonstrated at least some successful generalisation across people, settings, and/or activities. The findings did not support the widely reported generalisation 'difficulties' associated with autism. However, generalisation was not consistent across all skills within studies, and one study found no generalisation despite evidence for initial target learning within the intervention context. In general, there are few methodologically sound social communication intervention studies exploring generalisation in autism and no consensus on how it should be measured. In particular, failure to demonstrate initial learning of target skills within the intervention setting and an absence of formal mediation analyses of the hypothesised mechanisms limit current research. We outline a framework within which measurement of generalisation can be considered for use in future trials. To maximise the effectiveness of interventions, the field needs to gain a better understanding of the nature of generalisation among autistic individuals and what additional strategies may further enhance learning.

LAY SUMMARY: It is generally considered that autistic individuals experience difficulties applying things they have learned in one context into different settings (e.g. from school to home). This is important to consider for intervention studies. Our review does not support a complete lack of generalisation but instead suggests that after early social communication intervention, autistic children can transfer some skills to new contexts. Overall, there is limited research in this area and further work is needed."}, "pico": {"P": "Young children with autism", "I": "Early social communication interventions", "C": "No specific comparison group mentioned in the abstract", "O": "Generalisation of learned skills across people, settings, and/or activities"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00999778", "NCT00378157", "NCT00999778"]}

Methods A systematic search was conducted in bibliographic databases including PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection for English articles published from 1998 to 2018. The PICO strategy guided the assessment of study relevance and the bibliographical search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs in which (1) participants were adult workers with physically demanding work and MSD (including specific and non-specific MSD and musculoskeletal pain, symptoms, and discomfort), (2) interventions were initiated and/or carried out at the workplace, (3) a comparison group was included, and (4) a measure of MSD was reported (including musculoskeletal pain, symptoms, prevalence or discomfort). The quality assessment and evidence synthesis adhered to the guidelines developed by the Institute for Work & Health (Toronto, Canada) focusing on developing practical recommendations for stakeholders. Relevant stakeholders were engaged in the review process. Results Level of evidence from 54 high and medium quality studies showed moderate evidence of a positive effect of physical exercise. Within this domain, there was strong evidence of a positive effect of workplace strength training. There was limited evidence for ergonomics and strong evidence for no benefit of participatory ergonomics, multifaceted interventions, and stress management. No intervention domains were associated with \"negative effects\". Conclusions The evidence synthesis recommends that implementing strength training at the workplace can reduce MSD among workers with physically demanding work. In regard to workplace ergonomics, there was not enough evidence from the scientific literature to guide current practices. Based on the scientific literature, participatory ergonomics and multifaceted workplace interventions seem to have no beneficial effect on reducing MSD among this group of workers. As these interventional domains were very heterogeneous, it should also be recognized that general conclusions about their effectiveness should be done with care.Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42018116752 ( https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=116752 )."}, "pico": {"P": "Adult workers with physically demanding work and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)", "I": "Workplace interventions to rehabilitate MSDs", "C": "Comparison group receiving standard care or no intervention", "O": "Reduction in musculoskeletal pain, symptoms, prevalence, or discomfort"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT01671267", "NCT01543984", "NCT02047669"]}

To review the efficacy and safety of antimuscarinics, alone or in combination with an \u03b1-blocker, for the treatment of men with OAB symptoms, we conducted a systematic review of articles published before 22 July 2010, using PubMed. Data from 12-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of tolterodine extended release (ER), oxybutynin and solifenacin show that combined antimuscarinic+\u03b1-blocker treatment is generally more effective than monotherapy or placebo in men with OAB symptoms. The efficacy and safety of tolterodine ER+\u03b1-blocker treatment was not affected by prostate size or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. In men meeting entry criteria for OAB and benign prostatic obstruction trials, tolterodine ER alone was effective selectively in men with prostate size or PSA level below study medians. Incidence of acute urinary retention (AUR) in men receiving antimuscarinics with or without an \u03b1-blocker was \u22643% in all of these trials; changes in postvoid residual volume and maximum flow rate did not appear clinically meaningful. Post hoc analyses from double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and prospective studies of fesoterodine, oxybutynin, propiverine, solifenacin and tolterodine also suggest that antimuscarinics are generally safe and efficacious in men. A retrospective database study found that risk of AUR in men was the highest in the first month of treatment and decreased considerably thereafter.

Currently, no comprehensive review has appraised and collected available evidence on the home (micro) physical environment. The purpose of this review was to examine how the home physical environment relates to adult and child PA and SD behaviors. Articles were searched during May 2014 using Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus databases which yielded 3265 potential studies. Papers were considered eligible if they investigated the presence of PA (ie. exercise equipment, exergaming devices) or SD (ie. television, videogames) equipment and PA or SD behavior. After, screening and manual cross-referencing, 49 studies (20 experimental and 29 observational designs) were found to meet the eligibility criteria. Interventions that reduced sedentary time by using TV limiting devices were shown to be effective for children but the results were limited for adults. Overall, large exercise equipment (ie. treadmills), and prominent exergaming materials (exergaming bike, dance mats) were found to be more effective than smaller devices. Observational studies revealed that location and quantity of televisions correlated with SD behavior with the latter having a greater effect on girls. This was similarly found for the quantity of PA equipment which also correlated with behavior in females. Given the large market for exercise equipment, videos and exergaming, the limited work performed on its effectiveness in homes is alarming.

Irrespective of their validity for diagnosing ADHD, neuropsychological tasks could provide valuable information to mental health professionals if they can inform recommendations for treatment targets and modalities. Therefore, this review sought to synthesize the available evidence related to the use of neuropsychological task performance as a tool for informing treatment planning for youth with ADHD. Reviewed studies focused on examinations of associations between task performance and academic, social, and health outcomes, as well as response to treatment. Twenty-five relevant studies using samples of youth diagnosed with ADHD in clinical, community, and school settings were identified. Review of the evidence suggests that task performance may be useful in identifying individuals with ADHD at risk for academic impairment. However, the evidence is less compelling for identifying youth at risk for impaired social functioning or poor health outcomes. The review also found that task performance is likely useful for predicting response to treatment with methylphenidate. Across studies, evidence indicated that interpreting task performance in an integrated manner, such as a factor score or mean score, was more consistently useful for predicting outcomes of interest than interpreting performance from a single task. Implications for the use of tasks in ADHD assessments are discussed, and future directions are outlined for further examining the clinical utility of task performance."}, "pico": {"P": "Youth diagnosed with ADHD in clinical, community, and school settings", "I": "Use of neuropsychological task performance as a tool for informing treatment planning for youth with ADHD", "C": "Standard care or alternative methods for treatment planning", "O": "Identification of individuals at risk for academic impairment, social functioning, and health outcomes; prediction of response to treatment with methylphenidate"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00000388", "NCT00000388"]}

Probiotics may be a promising solution. OBJECTIVE To examine whether probiotics are effective in the prevention/management of crying (\"colic\") in infants 3 months or younger. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, supplemented by the metaRegister of Controlled Trials. STUDY SELECTION Studies that randomized infants 3 months or younger to oral probiotics vs placebo or no or standard treatment with the outcome of infant crying, measured as the duration or number of episodes of infant crying/distress or diagnosis of \"infant colic.\" Twelve of the 1180 initially identified studies were selected. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS This review/meta-analysis was conducted according to guidelines from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, with reporting following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Data were independently extracted by 3 of us. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S) Infant crying, measured as the duration or number of episodes of infant crying/distress, or diagnosis of \"infant colic.\" RESULTS Of the 12 trials (1825 infants) reviewed, 6 suggested probiotics reduced crying, and 6 did not. Three of the 5 management trials concluded probiotics effectively treat colic in breastfed babies; 1 suggested possible effectiveness in formula-fed babies with colic, and 1 suggested ineffectiveness in breastfed babies with colic. Meta-analysis of 3 small trials of breastfed infants with colic found that Lactobacillus reuteri markedly reduced crying time at 21 days (median difference, -65 minutes/d; 95% CI, -86 to -44). However, all trials had potential biases. Meanwhile, of 7 prevention trials, 2 suggested possible benefits.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although L reuteri may be effective as treatment for crying in exclusively breastfed infants with colic, there is still insufficient evidence to support probiotic use to manage colic, especially in formula-fed infants, or to prevent infant crying.

Despite the serious consequences of substance use, only a few therapies are effective in treating substance use disorders, thus highlighting a need for improved treatment practices. Substance use treatment response depends on multiple factors such as genetic, biological, and social factors. It is essential that each component is represented in treatment plans. The dopaminergic system plays a critical role in the pharmacotherapy for addictions, and an understanding of the role of variation of genes involved in this system is essential for its success. This review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement guidelines. A computerized literature search was conducted using PubMed and Scopus (all databases). Articles published up to April 2015 that examined the role of dopaminergic gene variation in the pharmacotherapy of alcohol, opioid, and cocaine use disorders were reviewed.

After having corrected for these apparent mistakes, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we also accounted for a possible moderating effect of age; while this suggests SSRIs to be safe drugs in the non-elderly, they do confirm what is already known, that is, that they may enhance the risk for SAEs in the old. Given the loose definition of SAE, including also innocuous phenomena, the possible clinical significance of the latter observation, however, remains unclear until the nature and actual impact of the SAEs in question have been clarified.

Minimal ventricular pacing modalities have been demonstrated to reduce AF in such patients, although they are not suitable for patients with advanced atrioventricular conduction disease. Recent evidences suggest that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (i.e. statins) may represent a new strategy to prevent AF in patients at risk. In this article, we sought to review data regarding the effectiveness of statin therapy in preventing AF patients with a PM. We reviewed all available studies that assessed the effect of statin therapy on the occurrence of AF in patients with PM, implanted due to sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular conduction disease. Moreover, a random effect inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis was performed, by entering directly the logarithm of the hazard ratio (HR) of AF provided in the multiple Cox regression analyses from each study. Three studies were identified, including 552 patients, of whom 159 received statins. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 2.77 years. Two studies (one observational and one prospective randomized) included predominantly patients with sinus node dysfunction (70% and 91% of patient population, respectively) and, consistently, showed a beneficial effect of statins on the occurrence of AF. On the other hand, the study including predominantly patients with atrioventricular block (60% of patient population) failed to show a beneficial effect of statins on AF occurrence. The HR for AF occurrence for the cumulative data was found to be 0.43 (95% confidence interval: 0.28-0.67, P < 0.001). Statistical heterogeneity between included studies was not detected (chi(2) = 1.68, P = 0.43, I(2) = 0%), although significant clinical differences were found in terms of study design, patient populations, statins use and dosage and AF-monitoring capabilities.

A systematic review of the relationship between everyday stress, social connectedness, and allostatic load.", "abstract": "In the present review, we argue that social disconnectedness could and should be included in primary-care screening protocols for the detection of cardiometabolic disease. Empirical evidence indicates that weak social connectedness represents a serious risk factor for chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and various cancers. Weak social connectedness, however, is largely regarded as a second-tier health-risk factor in clinical and research settings. This may be because the mechanisms by which this factor impacts on physical health are poorly understood. Budding research, however, advances the idea that social connectedness buffers against stress-related allostatic load-a known precursor for cardiovascular disease and cancer. The present paper reviews the empirical knowledge on the relationship between everyday stress, social connectedness, and allostatic load. Of 6022 articles retained in the literature search, 20 met predefined inclusion criteria. These studies overwhelmingly support the notion that social connectedness correlates negatively with allostatic load. Several moderators of this relationship were also identified, including gender, social status, and quality of social ties. More research into these factors, however, is warranted to conclusively determine their significance. The current evidence strongly indicates that the more socially connected individuals are, the less likely they are to experience chronic stress and associated allostatic load. The negative association between social connectedness and various chronic diseases can thus, at least partially, be explained by the buffering qualities of social connectedness against allostatic load. We argue that assessing social connectedness in clinical and epidemiological settings may therefore represent a considerable asset in terms of prevention and intervention."}, "pico": {"P": "Adult patients at risk for cardiometabolic disease", "I": "Inclusion of social disconnectedness in primary-care screening protocols", "C": "Standard primary-care screening protocols without assessment of social disconnectedness", "O": "Reduced allostatic load and decreased risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00233220"]}

We performed a systematic review of the medical literature from inception through 15 June 2018 by utilizing PubMed and searching for key terms such as NAFLD, vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Data from studies and medical literature focusing on the role of vitamin E therapy in patients with NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were reviewed. Most studies assessing the impact of vitamin E in NAFLD were designed to evaluate patients with NASH with documented biochemical and histological abnormalities. These studies demonstrated improvement in biochemical profiles, with a decline in or normalization of liver enzymes. Furthermore, histological assessment showed favorable outcomes in lobular inflammation and hepatic steatosis following treatment with vitamin E. Current guidelines regarding the use of vitamin E in the setting of NAFLD recommend that vitamin E-based treatment be restricted to biopsy-proven nondiabetic patients with NASH only. However, some concerns have been raised regarding the use of vitamin E in patients with NASH due to its adverse effects profile and lack of significant improvement in hepatic fibrosis. In conclusion, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties of vitamin E accompanied by ease-of-use and exceptional tolerability have made vitamin E a pragmatic therapeutic choice in non-diabetic patients with histologic evidence of NASH. Future clinical trials with study design to assess vitamin E in combination with other anti-fibrotic agents may yield an additive or synergistic therapeutic effect."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)", "I": "Vitamin E supplementation", "C": "Standard care or placebo", "O": "Improvement in biochemical profiles, decline in liver enzymes, normalization of liver enzymes, favorable outcomes in lobular inflammation and hepatic steatosis"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00063635", "NCT01316081", "NCT00063622"]}

There is a growing body of research on the effectiveness of financial incentive interventions for health behaviours. Wide variations in the nature of these interventions make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about what makes an effective incentive, for whom and under what circumstances. Whilst there has been some recognition of the theoretical complexity of financial incentive interventions for health behaviours, there is no framework that categorises these interventions. This limits the research community's ability to clearly establish which components of financial incentives interventions are more and less effective, and how these components might interact to enable behavioural change. We propose a framework for describing health-promoting financial incentive interventions. Drawing on our experience of a recently completed systematic review, we identify nine domains that are required to describe any financial incentive intervention designed to help individuals change their health behaviours. These are: direction, form, magnitude, certainty, target, frequency, immediacy, schedule and recipient.

Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have addressed the benefits and risks of dietary protein intakes for bone health in adults. This narrative review of the literature summarizes and synthesizes recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses and highlights key messages. Adequate supplies of dietary protein are required for optimal bone growth and maintenance of healthy bone. Variation in protein intakes within the \"normal\" range accounts for 2-4% of BMD variance in adults. In older people with osteoporosis, higher protein intake (\u2265\u20090.8-g/kg body weight/day, i.e., above the current RDA) is associated with higher BMD, a slower rate of bone loss, and reduced risk of hip fracture, provided that dietary calcium intakes are adequate. Intervention with dietary protein supplements attenuate age-related BMD decrease and reduce bone turnover marker levels, together with an increase in IGF-I and a decrease in PTH. There is no evidence that diet-derived acid load is deleterious for bone health. Thus, insufficient dietary protein intakes may be a more severe problem than protein excess in the elderly.

Included in this review are eight randomized controlled trials that compared an NF condition, either alone or combined with medication, to a medication condition, which was mainly methylphenidate. Outcome measures included behavioral assessments by parents and teachers, self-reports, neurocognitive measures, electroencephalogram power spectra and event-related potentials. When only trials are considered that include probably blinded ratings or those that are sham-NF or semi-active controlled or those that employed optimally titration procedures, the findings do not support theta/beta NF as a standalone treatment for children or adolescents with ADHD. Nevertheless, an additive treatment effect of NF was observed on top of stimulants and theta/beta NF was able to decrease medication dosages, and both results were maintained at 6-month follow-up. This review concludes that the present role of NF in treating children diagnosed with ADHD should be considered as complementary in a multimodal treatment approach, individualized to the needs of the child, and may be considered a viable alternative to stimulants for a specific group of patients. Particularly patients with the following characteristics may benefit from NF treatment: low responders to medication, intolerable side effects due to medication, higher baseline theta power spectra and possibly having no comorbid psychiatric disorders. Future research should prioritize the identification of markers that differentiate responders from nonresponders to NF treatment, the potential of NF to decrease stimulant dosage, the standardization of NF treatment protocols and the identification of the most favorable neurophysiological treatment targets."}, "pico": {"P": "Children and adolescents diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)", "I": "Neurofeedback (NF) either alone or combined with medication", "C": "Stimulant medication, mainly methylphenidate", "O": "Behavioral assessments, self-reports, neurocognitive measures, electroencephalogram power spectra, event-related potentials, decrease in medication dosages, maintenance of results at 6-month follow-up"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT01363544", "NCT01363544", "NCT01363544"]}

Design Following PRISMA guidelines, papers published before March 2016 in Medline, Scopus-Elsevier, Scopus, ISI-Web of Knowledge and COCHRANE, and fulfilling established a-priori selection criteria have been included. Results In 40 original papers, three naturally present cannabinoids (\u2206-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, \u2206-8-Tetrahydrocannabinol and Cannabinol) and one human metabolite (11-OH-THC) had clinical relevance. Of these, the metabolite produces the greatest psychoactive effects. Cannabidiol (CBD) is not psychoactive but plays a modulating role on cannabis psychoactive effects. The proportion of 9-THC in plant material is higher (up to 40%) than in other cannabinoids (up to 9%). Pharmacodynamic reports vary due to differences in methodological aspects (doses, administration route and volunteers' previous experience with cannabis). Conclusions Findings reveal that 9-THC contributes the most to cannabis psychoactivity. Due to lower psychoactive potency and smaller proportions in plant material, other psychoactive cannabinoids have a weak influence on cannabis final effects. Current lack of standard methodology hinders homogenized research on cannabis health effects. Working on a standard cannabis unit considering 9-THC is recommended."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients using cannabis", "I": "Contribution of naturally present cannabinoids to cannabis psychoactivity", "C": "Comparison of different cannabinoids and their psychoactive effects", "O": "Identification of \u2206-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol as the main contributor to cannabis psychoactivity"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00225407"]}

A systematic search of the literature was performed in PubMed, and the available evidence was summarized both qualitatively and by meta-analysis. Only English language, observational studies measuring serum levels of 25(OH)D as the exposure were included, as this is the most robust measure of vitamin D levels. The search identified 23 manuscripts: two case-control, 12 cohort and nine cross-sectional studies.

Lipectomy, by means of liposuction or abdominoplasty, is a common plastic surgery procedure, which can remove substantial amounts of subcutaneous fat. This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of surgical removal of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue on body weight and fat mass in females in the short- and long-term. A systematic review was conducted using a predetermined protocol established according to the Cochrane Handbook's recommendations. PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to December 2014. Eligible studies were prospective studies with \u22651\u00a0month of follow-up that included female only individuals who underwent lipectomy of the abdominal region and reported on body weight, body mass index (BMI), or fat mass. Ten studies were included in this systematic review with a total of 231 individuals. A significant weight loss and BMI improvement were reported in 4 out of 5 studies with a mean follow-up of 1-2\u00a0months, but in none of the 5 studies with a longer follow-up (3-20\u00a0months). Fat mass showed a similar to weight change. The risk of bias was low for the two clinical trials but high for the observational studies included in the review. This systematic review revealed only a transient effect of abdominal lipectomy in body fat and weight in women, which fades a few months after the operation. These results corroborate the evidence from experimental and clinical studies, which support fat redistribution and compensatory fat growth, as a result of feedback mechanisms, triggered by fat removal. Additional clinical studies, with adequate follow-up, may further elucidate the long-term effects of abdominal lipectomy in body weight and composition.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials was performed to evaluate the effect of FRC on cardiovascular risk factors and to assess a dose-response relationship.

Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs have been focused mainly in minimal invasive surgery approach during lung resection and respiratory rehabilitation after surgery.

Prehabilitation is a safe intervention without side effects in patients. High-intensity interval training (HIT) with duration of 2 to 6 weeks seems to be the best exercise programme in a prehabilitation intervention but it exists heterogeneity in terms of intensity and duration. Prehabilitation increase exercise capacity and significantly enhances pulmonary function. But the reduction of postoperative complication and mortality has not been clearly demonstrated. Different criteria selection, type of intervention and small sample size, in addition to no randomization, could justify disparate results. It seems that not all patients can benefit from prehabilitation and it could be indicated only in patients with impaired lung function.

To examine whether the more recently published meta-analyses and trials would change past conclusions, we systematically reviewed meta-analyses of vitamin D supplementation and non-skeletal disorders published between Jan 1, 2013, and May 31, 2017, that included study participants of all ages, including pregnant women. We also searched for randomised trials not included in meta-analyses. We identified 87 meta-analyses, of which 52 were excluded because they contained less recent literature or were of suboptimal quality. We retrieved 202 articles on trials that were not included in meta-analyses. Recent meta-analyses reinforce the finding that 10-20 \u03bcg per day of vitamin D can reduce all-cause mortality and cancer mortality in middle-aged and older people. Although vitamin D doses were greater than those assessed in the past, we found no new evidence that supplementation could have an effect on most non-skeletal conditions, including cardiovascular disease, adiposity, glucose metabolism, mood disorders, muscular function, tuberculosis, and colorectal adenomas, or on maternal and perinatal conditions. New data on cancer outcomes were scarce. The compilation of results from 83 trials showed that vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on biomarkers of systemic inflammation. The main new finding highlighted by this systematic review is that vitamin D supplementation might help to prevent common upper respiratory tract infections and asthma exacerbations. There remains little evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplementation has an effect on most conditions, including chronic inflammation, despite use of increased doses of vitamin D, strengthening the hypothesis that low vitamin D status is a consequence of ill health, rather than its cause. We further hypothesise that vitamin D supplementation could exert immunomodulatory effects that strengthen resistance to acute infections, which would reduce the risk of death in debilitated individuals. We identified many meta-analyses of suboptimal quality, which is of concern. Future systematic reviews on vitamin D should be based on data sharing so that data for participants with the same outcomes measured in the same way can be pooled to generate stronger evidence."}, "pico": {"P": "Adults, including pregnant women, with non-skeletal health conditions", "I": "Vitamin D supplementation", "C": "Placebo or no supplementation", "O": "Effect on non-skeletal disorders, including all-cause mortality, cancer mortality, upper respiratory tract infections, asthma exacerbations, biomarkers of systemic inflammation"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT01229891", "NCT00685594", "NCT01052051", "NCT00000611", "NCT00856947", "NCT00000611", "NCT00000611", "NCT00153816", "NCT01130181", "NCT00920621"]}

Increasing evidence demonstrates that energy deficiency plays a causal role in the induction of amenorrhoea in exercising women, and consistent with this mechanism are findings of glucoregulatory perturbations such as low triiodothyronine, reduced insulin secretion and elevated cortisol, growth hormone and ghrelin levels. The menstrual disturbance that may differ in its energetic characteristics and, perhaps in its androgenic and ovarian steroid environment, is oligomenorrhoea. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to begin to understand whether oligomenorrhoea in exercising women is a mild subclinical phenotype of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in which exercise is conferring beneficial effects in protecting women from the classic PCOS phenotype, or whether oligomenorrhoea is part of the spectrum of menstrual disturbances caused by an energy deficiency that is often reported in exercising women with menstrual disturbances. We included observational, randomized controlled trials and cross-sectional studies that reported clinical, hormonal and metabolic profiles in exercising women with amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea and in women with PCOS. Previous studies examining the underlying mechanisms and consequences of exercise-associated menstrual disturbances have grouped exercising amenorrhoeic and oligomenorrhoeic women into a single group, and have relied primarily on self-reported menstrual history. Although scarce, the data available to date suggest that hyperandrogenism, such as that observed in PCOS, may likely be associated with oligomenorrhoea in exercising women, and may not always represent hypothalamic inhibition secondary to an energy deficiency. It is critical to closely examine the metabolic and endocrine status of women with menstrual disturbances because the treatment strategies for energy deficiency-related menstrual disturbances differ from that of disturbances traceable to hyperandrogenaemia. Further investigation is necessary to explore whether different endocrine aetiologies underly menstrual disturbances, particularly oligomenorrhoea, in physically active women."}, "pico": {"P": "Exercising women with oligomenorrhoea", "I": "Metabolic and endocrine status examination", "C": "Comparison between oligomenorrhoea in exercising women and women with PCOS", "O": "Identification of potential differences in underlying endocrine aetiologies and appropriate treatment strategies"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00473538"]}

High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and sucrose are the most important dietary sweeteners. Both HFCS and sucrose have overlapping metabolic actions with adverse effects attributed to their fructose moiety. Ecological studies have linked the rise in fructose availability with the increases in obesity and diabetes worldwide. This link has been largely underpinned by animal models and select human trials of fructose overfeeding at high levels of exposure. Although prospective cohort studies have shown significant associations comparing the highest with the lowest levels of intake sugar-sweetened beverages, these associations are small, do not hold at moderate levels of intake and are subject to collinearity effects from related dietary and lifestyle factors. Most systematic reviews and meta-analyses from controlled feeding trials have shown that fructose-containing sugars in isocaloric exchange for other carbohydrates do not show evidence of harm and, in the case of fructose, may even have advantages for glycaemic control, especially at small doses. Nevertheless, trials in which fructose-containing sugars supplement diets with excess energy have shown adverse effects, effects that appear more attributable to the excess energy than the sugar. There is no unequivocal evidence that fructose intake at moderate doses is directly related with adverse metabolic effects, although there is potentially cause for concern where fructose is provided at high doses or contributes excess energy to diets.

Background The addition of hip strengthening to knee strengthening for persons with patellofemoral pain has the potential to optimize treatment effects. There is a need to systematically review and pool the current evidence in this area. Objective To examine the efficacy of hip strengthening, associated or not with knee strengthening, to increase strength, reduce pain, and improve activity in individuals with patellofemoral pain. Methods A systematic review of randomized and/or controlled trials was performed. Participants in the reviewed studies were individuals with patellofemoral pain, and the experimental intervention was hip and knee strengthening. Outcome data related to muscle strength, pain, and activity were extracted from the eligible trials and combined in a meta-analysis. Results The review included 14 trials involving 673 participants. Random-effects meta-analyses revealed that hip and knee strengthening decreased pain (mean difference, -3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.6, -1.1) and improved activity (standardized mean difference, 1.4; 95% CI: 0.03, 2.8) compared to no training/placebo. In addition, hip and knee strengthening was superior to knee strengthening alone for decreasing pain (mean difference, -1.5; 95% CI: -2.3, -0.8) and improving activity (standardized mean difference, 0.7; 95% CI: 0.2, 1.3). Results were maintained beyond the intervention period. Meta-analyses showed no significant changes in strength for any of the interventions. Conclusion Hip and knee strengthening is effective and superior to knee strengthening alone for decreasing pain and improving activity in persons with patellofemoral pain; however, these outcomes were achieved without a concurrent change in strength.

Whether this effect is less pronounced with vasodilating \u03b2-blockers (VBB) when compared with nonvasodilating \u03b2-blockers (NVBB) remains unsettled. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials exploring the effects of \u03b2-blockers on both pSBP and cSBP in hypertension. We selected 20 studies, for a total of 32 treatment arms (n=21 for NVBB, n=11 for VBB) and 1263 participants (n=962 for NVBB, n=301 for VBB). pSBP decreased from 150 to 133 mm Hg for NVBB and from 145 to 134 mm Hg for VBB. cSBP decreased from 137 to 126 mm Hg for NVBB and from 132 to 123 mm Hg for VBB. SBP amplification (pSBP-cSBP) decreased significantly under VBB (-5.6 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -7.8, -3.4 mm Hg), but not under NVBB (-1.1 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -3.4, +1.2 mm Hg; P<0.01 versus NVBB). There was high heterogeneity both within and between \u03b2-blockers subclasses. In a meta-regression model, the weighted difference in treatment-induced changes in SBP amplification between NVBB and VBB lost its significance after adjustment for mean age and baseline pSBP and heart rate (-2.9\u00b12.3 mm Hg; P=0.22) and was almost abolished after adjustment for treatment-induced heart rate changes (-0.1\u00b10.5 mm Hg; P=0.78).

A structured search using MeSH-vocabulary and Title/Abstract-searches was conducted in PubMed for January 2000 to June 2011, identifying weight gain and exercise or physical activity as study topics, and aged adults as target group. In study selection, all types of exercise and physical activity and any measure of weight change in aged adults (\u226565 years) or postmenopausal women were considered. N=9 primary studies were identified. All were conducted in the US, with one study additionally including samples from Canada and the UK. Three studies focused on aged adults, while six concentrated specifically on postmenopausal women. Forms of exercise or physical activity comprised self-reported exercise history in four studies and low, moderate or high intensity exercise interventions in five studies. Four studies combined exercise with a hypocaloric diet and included comparison groups receiving either diet only, health education, stretching or a delayed intervention (one study each). Exercise was associated with weight loss (1.1-6 kg) in all intervention studies, all of which studied an overweight sample, and with weight maintenance in most observational studies, all of which studied a general population or otherwise overweight-unspecific sample. In sum, exercise and physical activity can effectively prevent weight gain in older adults and postmenopausal women either in terms of weight loss or maintenance. They can preserve lean body mass and thus are important for the balance between potentially positive and negative effects of weight reduction in later life. In addition, since all intervention studies were conducted with an overweight sample, it seems that primordial prevention (in terms of preventing the development of risk factors such as excess weight in the first place) might be a neglected issue in geriatric and postmenopausal prevention."}, "pico": {"P": "Older adults (\u226565 years) or postmenopausal women", "I": "Exercise and physical activity", "C": "Comparison groups receiving either diet only, health education, stretching, or a delayed intervention", "O": "Weight loss or maintenance, preservation of lean body mass"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00303875"]}

This narrative review synthesises and presents the current evidence from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and latest clinical trials on N-acetylcysteine for addiction and substance abuse, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and mood disorders. Good evidence exists to support the use of N-acetylcysteine as an adjunct treatment to reduce the total and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. N-acetylcysteine also appears to be effective in reducing craving in substance use disorders, especially for the treatment of cocaine and cannabis use among young people, in addition to preventing relapse in already abstinent individuals. Effects of N-acetylcysteine on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, as well as on mood disorders, remain unclear with mixed reviews, even though promising evidence does exist. Larger and better-designed studies are required to further investigate the clinical effectiveness of N-acetylcysteine in these areas.

Patients on DAPT are at risk of both ischaemic and bleeding events. Although side-lined for a long time, real-life studies have shown that both the incidence and the associated morbidity and mortality of out-of-hospital bleeding are high. This indicates that prevention of (post-interventional) bleeding is as important as prevention of ischaemia. For this purpose it is crucial to reliably identify patients with a high bleeding risk. In order to postulate an algorithm, which could help identifying these patients, we performed a systematic review to determine the value of previously proposed prognostic modalities for bleeding. We searched and appraised the following tools: platelet function tests, genetic tests, bleeding scores and questionnaires and haemostatic tests. Most studies indicated that low on-treatment platelet reactivity (LTPR), as measured by several platelet function tests, and the carriage of CYP2C19*17 allele were independent risk factors for bleeding. A bleeding score also proved to be helpful in identifying patients at risk. No studies on haemostatic tests were retrieved. Several patient characteristics were also identified as independent predictors of bleeding, such as older age, female sex and renal failure. Combining these risk factors we propose an algorithm that would hypothetically facilitate identification of those patients at highest risk, warranting prevention measures for bleeding.

As such, consistent high levels of exercise should be encouraged across the lifespan, to limit the risk of developing one of these conditions and allowing for healthy aging to occur. Exercise prescriptions that encourage high completion and adherence rates in an independent manner and improve health related outcomes should be provided to individuals. To date, no review has identified optimal prescriptions of exercise to achieve this in sedentary middle-aged adults and this is important, given the higher risk of developing illnesses in this population as they age. This review examines the effects prescriptions of self-directed (SD) exercise has on adherence and health related outcomes in sedentary middle-aged individuals in good general health currently and aims to identify the most suitable forms of planned SD exercise that can be carried out independently. A systematic search of the electronic database PubMed was conducted. Randomised controlled trials published in English between February 2007 and February 2017 examining healthy, sedentary middle-aged participants only were included. Studies were critically appraised using the PEDro scale and data were presented on standardised tables. Twenty-one articles examining different aerobic activities, combined training and non-traditional exercise prescriptions were included.

Specific design considerations included subject identification, timing and duration of treatment, outcomes, timing of assessment, and adjusting for risk factors in the analyses.

These examples were selected because they are representative models of primary and secondary prevention, reflect persistent pain resulting from multiple insults (ie, surgery, viral infection, injury, and toxic or noxious element exposure), and are chronically painful conditions that are treated with a range of interventions. Improvements in the design of chronic pain prevention trials could improve assay sensitivity and thus accelerate the identification of efficacious interventions.

The aim was to briefly present the pathophysiology, followed by a balanced overview of the different forms of iron replacement available, and subsequently, to perform a systematic review of studies performed in the last decade on the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in IBD. Given that intravenous therapies have been introduced in the last decade, a systematic review performed in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and the websites of WHO, FDA, and EMA covered prospective trials investigating the management of iron-deficiency anemia in IBD published since 2004. A total of 632 articles were reviewed, and 13 articles (2906 patients) with unique content were included. In general, oral supplementation in iron-deficiency anemia should be administered with a target to restore/replenish the iron stores and the hemoglobin level in a suitable way. However, in patients with IBD flares and inadequate responses to or side effects with oral preparations, intravenous iron supplementation is the therapy of choice. Neither oral nor intravenous therapy seems to exacerbate the clinical course of IBD, and intravenous iron therapy can be administered even in active disease stages and concomitantly with biologics. In conclusion, because many physicians are in doubt as to how to manage anemia and iron deficiency in IBD, there is a clear need for the implementation of evidence-based recommendations on this matter. Based on the data presented, oral iron therapy should be preferred for patients with quiescent disease stages and trivial iron deficiency anemia unless such patients are intolerant or have an inadequate response, whereas intravenous iron supplementation may be of advantage in patients with aggravated anemia or flares of IBD because inflammation hampers intestinal absorption of iron."}, "pico": {"P": "Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and iron-deficiency anemia", "I": "Management of iron-deficiency anemia in IBD, including oral and intravenous iron supplementation", "C": "Comparison between oral and intravenous iron supplementation in patients with IBD and iron-deficiency anemia", "O": "Effectiveness of oral vs. intravenous iron supplementation in restoring iron stores and hemoglobin levels, impact on disease course of IBD, tolerability, and response rates"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00520780", "NCT00414713", "NCT00810004"]}

Studies in which probiotics/prebiotics were not administered during the manufacturing process, but thereafter, for example in capsules, the contents of which were supplemented to infant formula or feeds, were excluded.On the basis of this review, available scientific data suggest that the administration of currently evaluated probiotic- and/or prebiotic-supplemented formula to healthy infants does not raise safety concerns with regard to growth and adverse effects. The safety and clinical effects of 1 product should not be extrapolated to other products. At present, there is insufficient data to recommend the routine use of probiotic- and/or prebiotic-supplemented formulae.

PA is an important marker of health and quality of life in older adults. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to assess the effect of exercise-based interventions on an at least six-month follow up PA measure, and to describe the specific strategies implemented during the intervention to strengthen the sustainability of PA in community-dwelling 65+ year-old adults. We registered and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42017070892) of randomized clinical trials (RCT). We searched three electronic databases during January 2018 to identify RCT assessing any type of exercise-based intervention. Studies had to report a pre-, post-, and at least 6-month post-intervention follow-up. To be included, at least one PA outcome had to be assessed. The effect of exercise-based interventions was assessed compared to active (e.g., a low-intensity type of exercise, such as stretching or toning activities) and non-active (e.g., usual care) control interventions at several time points. Secondary analyses were conducted, restricted to studies that reported specific strategies to enhance the sustainability of PA. The intervention effect was measured on self-reported and objective measures of time spent in PA, by means of standardized mean differences. Standardized mean differences of PA level were pooled. Pooled estimates of effect were computed with the DerSimonian-Laird method, applying a random effects model. The risk of bias was also assessed. We included 12 studies, comparing 18 exercise intervention groups to four active and nine non-active control groups. Nine studies reported specific strategies to enhance the long-term sustainability of PA. The strategies were mostly related to the self-efficacy, self-control, and behavior capability principles based on the social cognitive theory. Exercise interventions compared to active control showed inconclusive and heterogeneous results.

To the present, these data have not been the subject matter of formal review. Accordingly, we conducted a systematic review to assess the association between perioperative vitamin D status and outcomes after surgery.

Fifteen studies employed prospective observational designs, 3 used prospective randomized protocols, and 13 report retrospective database interrogations. The main finding of the present review is that 26 of 31 studies (84%) report at least one statistically significant worse outcome in patients with low vitamin D status. Five of 31 studies (16%) found no association. In conclusion, this review supports the hypothesis that hypovitaminosis D is associated with adverse outcomes after diverse surgical procedures.

We performed a systematic review to identify direct and indirect effects of stimulant therapy on long-term outcome in adults. Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 10 open-label extension studies of initial short-term RCTs, with total follow-up of at least 24weeks, were identified. All these RCTs found that medication was significantly more efficacious than placebo in treating ADHD in adults, and the extension studies showed that this favorable effect of medication was maintained during the open-label follow-up period.

Given their immune modulatory properties, probiotics have been proposed as a strategy for management of CMPA. We aimed to systematically review efficacy and safety of probiotics in the management of CMPA. Databases PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Library, and Google scholar were searched in August 2018 for randomized controlled trials (RCT) of probiotic supplementation as an adjunct in the management of infants with suspected/proven CMPA. Primary outcomes were resolution of hematochezia and acquisition of tolerance to CMP at 6, 12, 24, and 36\u00a0months. Secondary outcomes included effect on allergic symptoms (SCORAD index), growth, gut microbiota, and adverse effects. A total of 10 RCTs (n\u2009=\u2009845; probiotics, 422; control, 423) with low to unclear risk of bias were included.

Prospective cohort studies, which provide the strongest observational evidence, have shown an association between fructose-containing sugars and cardiometabolic risk including weight gain, cardiovascular disease outcomes and diabetes only when restricted to sugar-sweetened beverages and not for sugars from other sources. In fact, sugar-sweetened beverages are a marker of an unhealthy lifestyle and their drinkers consume more calories, exercise less, smoke more and have a poor dietary pattern. The potential for overconsumption of sugars in the form of sugary foods and drinks makes targeting sugars, as a source of excess calories, a prudent strategy.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Bibliographic databases were searched up to July 2012. Included studies had a follow-up of \u226512 months and outcomes comparing change in body composition, glycemic control, or progression to diabetes. Lifestyle interventions aimed to translate evidence from previous efficacy trials of diabetes prevention into real-world intervention programs. Data were combined using random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression considering the relationship between intervention effectiveness and adherence to guidelines. RESULTS Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. The primary meta-analysis included 22 studies (24 study groups) with outcome data for weight loss at 12 months. The pooled result of the direct pairwise meta-analysis shows that lifestyle interventions resulted in a mean weight loss of 2.12 kg (95% CI -2.61 to -1.63; I(2) = 91.4%). Adherence to guidelines was significantly associated with a greater weight loss (an increase of 0.3 kg per point increase on a 12-point guideline-adherence scale). CONCLUSIONS Evidence suggests that pragmatic diabetes prevention programs are effective. Effectiveness varies substantially between programs but can be improved by maximizing guideline adherence.

The need for dose adjustment following bariatric surgery was examined, as well as the potential for extrapolation to other drugs subjected to coinciding pharmacokinetic mechanisms.

In the case of the majority of studied drugs, an increased absorption rate was observed early after RYGBP. The effect on systemic exposure allows for a low degree of extrapolation, including between drugs subjected to the same major metabolic and transporter pathways. On the basis of current understanding, predicting the pharmacokinetic change for a specific drug following RYGBP is challenging.

Although fatigue is a frequent complaint among patients with fibromyalgia, it has not received the same attention as pain. Reasons for this include lack of standardized nomenclature to communicate about fatigue, lack of evidence-based guidelines for fatigue assessment, and a deficiency in effective treatment strategies. Fatigue does not occur in isolation; rather, it is present concurrently in varying severity with other fibromyalgia symptoms such as chronic widespread pain, unrefreshing sleep, anxiety, depression, cognitive difficulties, and so on. Survey-based and preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that multiple symptoms feed into fatigue and it may be associated with a variety of physiological mechanisms. Therefore, fatigue assessment in clinical and research settings must consider this multi-dimensionality. While no clinical trial to date has specifically targeted fatigue, randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses indicate that treatment modalities studied in the context of other fibromyalgia symptoms could also improve fatigue. The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) Fibromyalgia Working Group and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) have been instrumental in propelling the study of fatigue in fibromyalgia to the forefront.

Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to determine the relationship between sedentary behaviour and health indicators in school-aged children and youth aged 5-17 years. Online databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO), personal libraries and government documents were searched for relevant studies examining time spent engaging in sedentary behaviours and six specific health indicators (body composition, fitness, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease, self-esteem, pro-social behaviour and academic achievement). 232 studies including 983,840 participants met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Television (TV) watching was the most common measure of sedentary behaviour and body composition was the most common outcome measure. Qualitative analysis of all studies revealed a dose-response relation between increased sedentary behaviour and unfavourable health outcomes. Watching TV for more than 2 hours per day was associated with unfavourable body composition, decreased fitness, lowered scores for self-esteem and pro-social behaviour and decreased academic achievement. Meta-analysis was completed for randomized controlled studies that aimed to reduce sedentary time and reported change in body mass index (BMI) as their primary outcome. In this regard, a meta-analysis revealed an overall significant effect of -0.81 (95% CI of -1.44 to -0.17, p = 0.01) indicating an overall decrease in mean BMI associated with the interventions. There is a large body of evidence from all study designs which suggests that decreasing any type of sedentary time is associated with lower health risk in youth aged 5-17 years.

Studies that report the evaluation or use of the 6MWT, ISWT or ESWT were included. We searched electronic databases for studies published between January 2000 and September 2013. The 6-min walking distance (6MWD) is a reliable measure (intra-class correlation coefficients ranged from 0.82 to 0.99 in seven studies). There is a learning effect, with greater distance walked on the second test (pooled mean improvement of 26 m in 13 studies). Reliability was similar for ISWT and ESWT, with a learning effect also evident for ISWT (pooled mean improvement of 20 m in six studies).

The goal of the current systematic review was to characterize the existing literature on this topic and to evaluate the credibility of CBD as a candidate pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Using a comprehensive search strategy, 303 unique potential articles were identified and 12 ultimately met criteria for inclusion (8 using rodent models, 3 using healthy adult volunteers, and 1 using cell culture). In both rodent and cell culture models, CBD was found to exert a neuroprotective effect against adverse alcohol consequences on the hippocampus. In rodent models, CBD was found to attenuate alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity, specifically, alcohol-induced steatosis. Finally, findings from preclinical rodent models also indicate that CBD attenuates cue-elicited and stress-elicited alcohol seeking, alcohol self-administration, withdrawal-induced convulsions, and impulsive discounting of delayed rewards. In human studies, CBD was well tolerated and did not interact with the subjective effects of alcohol. Collectively, given its favorable effects on alcohol-related harms and addiction phenotypes in preclinical models, CBD appears to have promise as a candidate AUD pharmacotherapy. This is further bolstered by the absence of abuse liability and its general tolerability. A clear limitation to the literature is the paucity of human investigations.

We included RCTs with at least 6 months of follow-up, comparing the direct effects of psychological interventions to usual care for patients following myocardial infarction or revascularisation or with a diagnosis of angina pectoris or CHD defined by angiography.

Studies were pooled using random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression was used to explore study-level predictors. Results Thirty-five studies with 10,703 participants (median follow-up 12 months) were included. Psychological interventions led to a reduction in cardiovascular mortality (rfcelative risk 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63 to 0.98), although no effects were observed for total mortality, myocardial infarction or revascularisation.

Literature searches, study selection, method development and quality appraisal were performed independently by two authors, and data was synthesized using a narrative approach. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria and were consequently analyzed. The review had five main findings. First, during anorexia nervosa adolescent females lose more central body fat, while adult females more peripheral fat. Second, partial weight restoration leads to greater fat mass deposition in the trunk region than other body regions in adolescent females. Third, after short-term weight restoration, whether partial or complete, adults show a central adiposity phenotype with respect to healthy age-matched controls. Fourth, central fat distribution is associated with increased insulin resistance, but does not adversely affect eating disorder psychopathology or cause psychological distress in female adults. Fifth, the abnormal central fat distribution seems to normalize after long-term maintenance of complete weight restoration, indicating that preferential central distribution of body fat is a transitory phenomenon. However, a discrepancy in the findings has been noted, especially between adolescents and adults; besides age and gender, these appear to be related to differences in the methodology and time of body composition assessments.

While masks are known to substantially reduce disease transmission in healthcare settings [D. K. Chu et al., Lancet 395, 1973\u20131987 (2020); J. Howard et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 118, e2014564118 (2021); Y. Cheng et al., Science eabg6296 (2021)], studies in community settings report inconsistent results [H. M. Ollila et al., medRxiv (2020); J.

Most such studies focus on how masks impact transmission, by analyzing how effective government mask mandates are. However, we find that widespread voluntary mask wearing, and other data limitations, make mandate effectiveness a poor proxy for mask-wearing effectiveness. We directly analyze the effect of mask wearing on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, drawing on several datasets covering 92 regions on six continents, including the largest survey of wearing behavior (n= 20 million) [F. Kreuter et al., https://gisumd.github.io/COVID-19-API-Documentation (2020)]. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model, we estimate the effect of mask wearing on transmission, by linking reported wearing levels to reported cases in each region, while adjusting for mobility and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as bans on large gatherings.

The comparison between the two methods has also been the subject of a Cochrane meta-analysis performed by Sauerland et al. (Cochrane Database Syst Rev 3: CD007781, 2011), which pointed out how, in spite of many clinical trials indicating the superiority of laparoscopy in terms of invasiveness and postoperative pain control, the quality of evidence is low due to the excessive variability among the different series in terms of reported complications. Moreover, what should be the selection criteria of patients fit for laparoscopic treatment in day surgery is not yet defined. This retrospective study considered 94 patients with primary or recurrent incisional wall hernias treated with laparoscopic technique over a 7-year period of time, from 2011 to 2018. The aim was to define the selection criteria for an effective day surgery laparoscopic treatment, considering as outcome the rate of conversion to ordinary hospitalization (discharge\u2009>\u2009POD1). Discharge\u2009>\u2009POD 1 was necessary in 15 cases out of 94 (16%). Concerning this outcome, statistically significant risk factors were ASA score\u2009>\u2009I (p\u2009=\u20090.022), number of hernia orifices\u2009>\u20091 (p\u2009=\u20090.001), recurrent hernias (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and hernia diameter\u2009>\u200910\u00a0cm (p\u2009<\u20090.0001).

More recently it has become clear that they also communicate with other cell-types; including chondrocytes in articular cartilage. One way that this process is facilitated is by interstitial fluid movement within the pericellular and extracellular matrices. This stimulus is also an important mechanical signal in skeletal tissues, and is known to generate shear stresses at the micron-scale (known as fluid flow shear stresses (FFSS)). The primary aim of this study was to develop and characterize an in vitro bone-cartilage crosstalk system, to examine the effect of FFSS on these cell types. Specifically, we evaluated the response of osteoblasts and chondrocytes to FFSS and the effect of FFSS-induced soluble factors from the former, on the latter. This system will ultimately be used to help us understand the role of subchondral bone damage in articular cartilage degeneration. We also carried out a comparison of responses between cell lines and primary murine cells in this work. Our findings demonstrate that primary cells produce a more reliable and reproducible response to FFSS. Furthermore we found that at lower magnitudes , direct FFSS produces anabolic responses in both chondrocytes and osteoblasts, whereas higher levels produce more catabolic responses. Finally we show that exposure to osteoblast-derived factors in conditioned media experiments produced similarly catabolic changes in primary chondrocytes."}, "pico": {"P": "Primary osteoblasts and chondrocytes", "I": "Exposure to fluid flow shear stress (FFSS)", "C": "No exposure to FFSS or lower levels of FFSS", "O": "Effect on osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation, communication, and potential role in articular cartilage degeneration"}, "trial_nctids": ["NCT00002550"]}

To test the effects of the specific bio-functionalities, modified and unmodified graphite rods were used as anodes in two-chamber microbial fuel cell devices. Devices were set up with wastewater as inoculum and acetate as nutrient and their performance, in terms of output potential (open circuit and 1 k\u03a9 load) and peak power output, was monitored over two months. The presence of glycans was found to lead to significant differences in startup times and peak power outputs. Lactosides were found to inhibit the development of biofilms when compared to bare graphite. Mannosides were found, instead, to promote exoelectrogenic biofilm adhesion and anode colonization, a finding that is supported by quartz crystal microbalance experiments in inoculum media.

All members of the original ISPMD consensus group were invited to submit one or more auditable standards to be eligible in the inclusion of the consensus. Ninety-five percent of members (18/19) responded with at least one auditable standard. A total of 66 auditable standards were received, which were returned to all group members who then ranked the standards in order of priority, before the results were collated. Proposed standards related to the diagnosis of PMDs identified the importance of obtaining an accurate history, that a symptom diary should be kept for 2\u00a0months prior to diagnosis and that symptom reporting demonstrates symptoms in the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle and relieved by menstruation. Regarding treatment, the most important standards were the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as a first line treatment, an evidence-based approach to treatment and that SSRI side effects are properly explained to patients.
